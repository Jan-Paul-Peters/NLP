        "Wisdom of the crowd: competition for the best short pick There is this theory if you ask sufficient number of sane i.e. not the entire market people a prediction they would do much better than an individual no matter what their background is. Can we beat an inverse of QQQ? i.e. I am talking about short with recommending the practice of shorting. Name 3 stocks/etfs that would perform most poorly between 06/06/22 to 12/31/22.  I will make an equal weighted performance of EACH suggestion at the end of the year and declare the winner. I will also make an equal weighted portfolio based on the entire thread and compare it with a straight up QQQ short. I will be writing an article about it.

        "Im now 40% cash. I dont care if markets go up or down Decided that Im comfortable at 40% cash.  I now no longer care if markets go up or down short term. If they go up Im happy and may take some more cash. If they go down 10 to 25% I start buying more with my 40% cash Got a lot of energy 16% etfs then diversified. I think either way in 5 years my portfolio will be higher. No point in checking it daily although I will. Basically now waiting for opportunities. I wont buy any more spx at this level.  Ill start buying more at about 3700 3600 and less. 3000 back up truck QQQ I got a little in since its beat down but maybe could go lower. But I think the idea in this market is to take profit as much as possible towards the fall and maintain around 40% to 50% cash.  No more though.  Then about 18 quality blue chips a few small gambles etc. Ill keep riding energy most likely all year and maybe next year Good luck all",
        "QQQ vs VOO  which should I invest in right now? Hello fairly new to stock investing. Want to put some money into an ETF while prices are falling. What is the better choice for investing right now with the declining prices? Also I am Canadian can someone please explain if I should invest in the US or the CAD equivalent.

        "Im about to make the worst financial decision of my life There is a chance this could be the worst financial decision of my life. Im going to make the case that it isnt but I have a feeling a lot of you may disagree. Im hoping to get the other perspective. Potential position: 300k in TQQQ I cant take it anymore. Ive been reading about leveraged ETFs for multiple days. They are no risk. A while ago I said I was going to buy regular stocks. Most of them were tech. I was told with my portfolio I might as well buy QQQ. Heres the no risk thesis: 10 years from now QQQ will be higher than it is right now. Its impossible for tech to shit the bed that hard for 10 years. Therefore any buys at these levels will be higher than they are in 10 years. If QQQ will go up. TQQQ will go up more. You dont need research this is common sense. The only risk is TQQQ could shut down if QQQ drops 33% in a day. That is literally impossible though. Tech is hammered so hard right now. Sure it will likely drop more but 33% in a day is apocalypse level shit. Even during Covid it didnt get that bad and people thought the world was ending. TQQQ will go lower than what I will buy it at. I will likely stomach large losses in this environment. To mitigate this I will buy in chunks as it drops every 5%. Every 5% drop from my average I would buy $15k. If it keeps dropping I may use margin although the risk of a margin call may not be worth it. The main thing is I can NEVER SELL. When QQQ finally recovers all these losses will be wiped out. Sure theres volatility decay and a .95% expense ratio but that is negligible to the returns one would make long term. Buying the dips in 2008 and 2020 on TQQQ would net you massive gains EVEN IF YOU CAUGHT THE FALLING KNIFE This dip in TQQQ is huge opportunity. Yes Ill likely catch a falling knife but that does not matter With such a low cost basis compared to when QQQ recovers decay and expense ratio are nothing. I might even wait for it to drop under $30 before entering. This requires and iron stomach but in the end it is guaranteed to workout. I would never check my portfolio performance in order to mask the wealth destruction. I believe this is a highly intelligent idea.",
        "Apple Samp;P500 influence more than entire energy or staples industry combined Apples weight in the SP500 is 6.5% while the entire total energy sector is worth 3.7% the entire consumer staples sector is worth 6% that means if the energy or staples sector going up like 100% which it did basically it doesnt matter if apple ends up dropping same percent. i dont see how this is even fair or accurate. I know its based on cap size but just one stock affect everything which people dont talk about. This is even more true in the QQQ but we all know that because its all tech in the QQQ Apple is 13% weighting MSFT is 10% but apple is weighted as much as GOOGL AMZN combined in there. so even if GOOGLAMZN does well it all just comes down to Apple. The flip side work too like if the entire QQQ sector crash which it did but AAPL somehow doesnt move then it just doesnt move. how is that even a fair influence or weighting for the whole market?",

        "Short the market or buy bearish ETFs until the fed stops QT. amp;x200B; Just my 2 cents from my experience in market cycles. The market is going to shit people are finally coming around to the idea recession and the signs have been there. I think its important to tread lightly going forward. The fed started QT as early as June 1st This month and they plan on doing so for at least the rest of the year. Their 2 main jobs are  Making sure unemployment is low  Moderating inflation amp;x200B; Notice how they dont mention how the stock market is doing. They have literally told you we are taking out liquidity from the markets and its only been 2 weeks. we still have half a year of this to go atleast.  What scares me truly is how the fed is so Dovish and how we have almost no history of QT you mix those 2 cocktails together it becomes for lack of a better word. A clusterfuck amp;x200B; TL;DR Until the fed stops QT the only logical conclusion is to DCA a bearish ETF I like PSQ 1x QQQ Bear or short the markets weekly. Just like QE threw valuations outta the window to save the economy QT will do the literal opposite. amp;x200B; Dude seriously ATLEAST WAIT until after the fed talks this week about raising rates before you decide to buy more this week.

        "Market Outlook 6/22/2022 Recap on yesterdays market action:  SPY closed up 2.52%  QQQ closed up 2.33%  Dow Jones Industrial closed up 2.15% Today was a good start to the market rally and recovery but we still have a lot of ground to cover before the bear market is truly shook. As for market news we still have the Fed Chair speaking Wednesday and Thursday and this may have an impact on the markets. SPY broke back above the resistance trendline support lines become resistance once they have been broken. Even though SPY broke above the line it did so on below average volume and started to fade into the close. If SPY can base above the trendline for a few days and then stage a rally that would be very productive. QQQ never broke below its support trendline however this does not mean that it is performing stronger than SPY. Today it was up on below average volume and also faded into the close closing about halfway through the daily range. Similarly to SPY if QQQ could base for a few days and then advance on volume that would start to signal a rally. GOOGL triggered a buy today when it took out Wednesdays high with volume. I considered opening a small position but missed the alert and by the time I saw it GOOGL had advanced approximately 1% past the buy point. Even if I had opened a position I likely would have sold partial shares 20% of position near the high and more shares 50% of remaining position when GOOGL came back to my buy point. This market is very choppy and thus makes take partial profits quickly essential. As of now GOOGL needs to take out the June 10th high with volume to be considered a buy. TSLA is acting slightly stronger that GOOGL at the moment. Also advancing past Wednesdays high with volume although we did see a fade into the close. Similarly to GOOGL I had planned to buy taking out the highs but missed the alerts I was occupied with a meeting. TSLA did form a downward sloping trendline that may provide an entry if it is taken out with volume and a good market. amp;x200B; Overall todays price action was constructive but no enough to become extremely bullish. This is simply one step on the long road to a health market. The indices may setup up for an entry but profits need to be taken quick and losses even quicker. As for individual stocks that show high probability setups they are few and far in between. My true favorites are currently only GOOGL and TSLA more may soon be added to this list. Stay focused and watch your stocks because the market has the ability to turn quickly.",
        "Whats your portfolio construction  of stocks/sector weights/nonequities? When I talk to buddies that manage money for a living the sad answer I get is either one of two things: Pretty much all Russel/Samp;P ETFs or super concentrated into a few punts usually in their alleged area of expertise worst was a guy that covers Uts and that made up 80% of his PA. The former makes some sense since most legit firms have coverage restrictions and holding requirements so its a real pain in the ass and your income/wealth is already proxy geared to your ability to not suck at picking stocks. The latter thoughweird. They should know better. Anyway Im curious what nonindustry people are doing with their own money. Are you balanced by sector weight? Do you hold 5 stocks or 40? Are you in alts or God forbid bonds? Ill go first: 1 Stocks: 16 2 Sector Benchmark Weights: Not even close. Im a former stock picker at a mutual fund covering healthcare and bit of tech before I started making YouTube videos in my basement in quasi retirement. HC and Tech Info Tech plus the shiny parts of CD and Comm. Services stocks are around 40% of my portfolio. Another 20% in other names but as a former growth investor its all pretty growthy and no RE UTs Mats or Energy the latter two I mess around in commodity form in ETFs. Other 40% is in ETFs  Samp;P always and I punt around other stuff on spec. Typically the Nasdaq Biotech Index IBB Russel 2K QQQ and some odd ball stuff like USO before the invasion and more recently a Chinese Tech ETF even made a video on it. 3 NonEquites: A few of the mainstream cryptos on and off since 2017 thank f not anymore and thats it. I dont plan on touching a bond until Im 65. Anyway curious what everyone else is doing. Figure since Im not picking stocks for a living anymore I should run a more big kid portfolio. Keen to hear some different allocation ideas. And if anyone has any qs happy to do my best to provide feedback and any teensy guidance I can.",

My own opinion is that megatech will absolutely continue to work  and at a minimum will colead with whatever else rises to the top.  Those behemoths have spent years building mountains of cash and IP that hasnt even seen the light of day yet. Books so spotless they make accountants blush.  Im not saying its going to be as easy street as recent years  but Ive rebalanced my own portfolio to increase the weighting of GOOG/L MSFT AMZN amp; AAPL in that order as I have full confidence that mix will continue to beat the Samp;P.

        "Market Outlook 06/28/2022 Recap on yesterdays market action:  SPY closed down 0.38%  QQQ closed down 0.73%  Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.20%  VIX closed down 1.10% The major indices all gapped up to open and quickly gave back their gains to close slightly lower on the day. Although many stocks closed down for the day this was still a constructive and much needed rest after last Fridays large gains. With that being said dont get overly bullish just yet. We still have a long ways to go before the market shakes off the past few months. SPY ran into the 21 day exponential moving average orange line right at the opened and quickly reversed. This was not an extremely strong reversal however with volume lower than Fridays run up and the average daily trading volume. What would be most constructive is if SPY ranged here for a few days to a week and then looked to advance even farther. SPY could also setup for a highlow by trending downwards slightly and then taking out todays highs. Conversely if we see strong selling in the next few days this may indicate more downwards action. QQQ behaved similarly to SPY however QQQ actually gapped up above its 21 day exponential moving average orange line but still closed slightly below. A week of range trading or even a slight downward trend would be constructive for QQQ as it would give some time before attempting a new advance. Recap on recent positions: Before the close on last Thursday I opened two small positions in AMZN amp; QLD. Both performed very well and Friday and today I was stopped out of both positions. My first shares of AMZN where bought at the pivot point shown by the yellow line. This was at the close of Thursday and as prices began to advance on Friday I bought a small amount of additional shares. Today I sold out of this position for a moderate gain of 1.80%. This is not an eye popping gain but in a choppy/whipsaw market I find it best to take smaller profits. QLD also turned out to be a nice buy into the close on Thursday. There was a slightly better base/enter here so my initial position was slightly larger. Again with Fridays price advance I bought additional shares throughout the day. Today I also sold all of my shares for an average gain of 4.30%. Could I have held to a few shares? Yes. Will I regret not? No. If QLD continues to advance there are several additional entry points possible. Potential Setups: Looking forward there are not many stocks that currently have high probability setups. GOOGL was discussed previously and has approached a month long base. If GOOGL can break above the highs set today with a large volume increase this could be the beginnings of a good run. O is also approaching a monthly base. This is very similar to GOOGL with the only difference being the O is a realty trust and thus may move bit slower in price increases. Overall market conditions are improving marginally compared to what they were two weeks ago. With that being said conditions can change quickly and price could revert to new lows. All we are able to do now is to create a list of potential stocks that are setting up or close to setting up. Market conditions still have a long way to go but always have to start changing somewhere.",
        "how do I deal with suicides from this bear market I knew of two people who already attempted suicide from this bear market. everywhere I go I see people people who last posted on twitter/finviz/here/anecdotally in March or may saying they were going to kill themselves. in a certain discord theres been a user who amassed a lot of capital gains in crypto and penny stocks back in 2021 due to getting around 1.5 MM which he had to pay off during this drawdown meaning he cannot DCA or buy the dip. the payment plan was 6k a month for a good 3 or 5 years.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 4th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 4th 2022.  Recession fears flare and June jobs report looms as jittery markets head into third quarter  Source  gt; Investors are greeting the third quarter with greater trepidation about a recession and that makes next Fridays June jobs report a potentially bigger catalyst for markets than it might otherwise have been.  gt; The jobs report and Wednesdays release of minutes from the Federal Reserves last interest rate meeting are expected to highlight the fourday postJuly 4th holiday week.  gt; Junes nonfarm payrolls are expected to have slowed from the 390000 added in May but still show solid job growth and a strong labor market. According to Dow Jones economists expect 250000 payrolls were added in June and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6%.  gt; But economists expect to see a slowing in the employment data from here out as the Feds tighter rates policy squeezes employers and the economy. There is a chance some of those cracks in the labor market could start to appear in the latest report. Some slowing would be seen as a positive but theres a balance between a slower less hot job market and one that has gotten too cool.  gt; Employment should slow from May. Whether it goes to 250000 consensus or more theres always volatility said David Page head of macro economic research at AXA Investment Managers. The trend is going to be lower and I wouldnt mind betting it would be in 150000 to 200000 by early Q3 and it could be certainly lower by the end of the year.  gt; A rate of 150000 to 200000 is still strong and closer to the prepandemic pace of job growth.  gt; Page said there has been a slowing in other data including consumer spending income and the employment component of the ISM June manufacturing survey. The employment component fell for a third month to 47.3. A level under 50 signals contraction.  gt; Thats part of a trend were seeing emerge. Its very evidently a slowdown in the economy Page said. The warning signs are starting to emerge and the more we see those warning signs start to trickle into the labor market the more the Federal Reserve is going to have to take heed and thats what puts such focus on next Fridays payroll report.  gt; On the other hand if the jobs number is particularly strong markets could react negatively since it would mean the Fed would feel forced to move ahead aggressively to fight inflation with larger rate hikes.  gt;  Fed impact gt; If the employment data is strong and the Fed officials on paper sound as hawkish as they do verbally I would think that would continue to put pressure on the market said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA. If one of the major barometers of how well higher rates are affecting the economy does not show it is affecting the economy. The implication or inference would be the Fed still has more to go.  gt; Many economists expect the Fed will raise interest rates by another 75 basis points at its next policy meeting in late July but the path for September is less certain.  gt; Page said he expects the Fed will debate the size of Julys hike more than the market believes and the central bank could end up raising rates by a lowerthanexpected 50 basis points. A basis point equals 0.01%. Page expects the Fed to be sensitive to the slowing economy and tightening of financial conditions.  gt; He noted there are few instances in history where the Fed has managed a soft landing on such a narrow landing strip.  gt; A major issue for markets is that the economy can easily fall into recession and it can be hard to predict. This week market pros became more concerned about an economic downturn after weaker data and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell indicated the Fed will do what it needs with interest rate hikes to tame inflation triggering worries the Fed will be willing to bring on a recession to slow price increases.  gt; You can be traveling along then you hit a certain tipping point Page said. It starts with something as amorphous as market sentiment. The market sentiment starts to evaporate...Thats when financial conditions start to tighten...That has a knock on to economic activity.  gt; Economists are divided on when and whether the economy will enter a recession but increasingly markets are pricing in an economic contraction.  gt; The Atlanta Feds GDP Now tracker shows the economy is already in a recession with a forecast of gross domestic product declining 2.1% in the second quarter. If that forecast were accurate it would make for a second negative quarter in a row or whats considered a recession on Wall Street. The first quarter contracted by 1.6%.  gt; Other economists however are not forecasting a recession for the current period and Page sees 1.5% growth in the second quarter.  gt;  New test for stocks? gt; Stocks in the past week were sharply lower as Treasury yields also fell on recession expectations. The 10year yield stood at 2.89% on Friday tumbling from 3.49% just two weeks ago. Some strategists had expected to see an up week for stocks as portfolio managers bought equities to rebalance their portfolios at the end of the second quarter.  gt; The Samp;P 500 rallied 1% Friday but was off 2.2% for the week ending at 3825. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% Friday but was down 4.1% for the week.  gt; Right now the market is trying to stabilize with some real quarterly flows said Scott Redler partner with T3Live.com. Redler said if the start of the new quarter and month does not bring in fresh money and support the market in the next several sessions that will be a negative sign for stocks and could signal that the market will soon test its lows.  gt; I think the market is caught between two narratives said Redler. I dont know if it wants good news or bad news. At first the hot economic news was bad because the Fed could go another 75 basis points and keep going but now the market wants softer news. But is the landing going to be soft or hard? Its like threading the needle right now.  gt; Redler said he believes the market is in the 7th inning of this correction.  gt; If you havent sold yet its probably not the time to do it. At this point its a high probability that we test the Samp;P 500 low of 3638 and then its just a question of whether we make new lows he said. A lot of people are focused on 3400 on the Samp;P 500.  gt; Strategists say the market will also focus on earnings season and many expect a choppy reaction once companies begin reporting and lowering future profit guidance. Earnings begin with big banks reporting July 14 and 15.  gt; The only bullish narrative the market has right now is it can go up on bad news said Redler. At this point its just a matter of how long this contraction will go that the Fed started. They wanted this.

The Samp;P 500 has already experienced 14 separate oneday declines of 2% or more this year. Thats nine more than the entire total for 2021 gt; While there are still another six months left in the year only ten other years have seen as many or more 2% daily declines in their entirety At the current pace 2022 would see 28 daily declines of 2% which would rank as tied with 2009 for the third most in the postWWII period trailing only 2002 29 and 2008 41. Not great company. If 2021 was the year where nothing could go wrong for investors 2022 has been the year where nothing is going right. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Strength Follows Weakness gt; Whether youre looking at monthly quarterly or firsthalf performance this years Samp;P 500 performance has been quite weak. As investors we must avoid falling into the sunkencost fallacy and are forced to be forwardlooking. gt; Starting with weak months there have been a total of 83 months in the postWWII era in which the Samp;P 500 declined at least 5%. In fact this has occurred three times in 2022 alone and if the current pace continues will top the postWWII high in 2008 when there were five months of 5% declines. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In addition to 5% monthly declines we also looked at periods where the Samp;P 500 declined 10% as well as sixmonth periods when the Samp;P 500 fell 20% with no prior occurrences in the last three months. Over the following day performance was inline with the historical average following 5% monthly declines and 10% quarterly declines but the first trading day following a sixmonth decline of 20% was much better than the historical average. Over the following week and month though the picture looks different as performance after 10% quarterly declines has been much better than average while performance following 20% sixmonth declines has been well below average. In terms of the week and month after 5% monthly declines returns have pretty much been in line with the historical average. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Taking a look at positivity rates percent of the time the Samp;P 500 has posted gains in a respective period the Samp;P 500 has boasted above average rates following a monthly decline of 5% in both the next day and month but rates are lower over the following week. After quarterly declines of 10% positivity rates were lower in the following day but above average for the following week and month coming in at 61.9% and 71.4% respectively. On the downside positivity rates were much lower following the first rolling six month decline of 20% in the next week and month coming in at 40.0% for both. Investors should note that the first occurrence of a 20% rolling six month decline occurred on June 16th. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Gasoline Burning Up gt; As we noted in todays Chart of the Day inflation data has been moderating and so too have gas prices as demand has pulled back and refinery output rises as we discussed in last nights Closer. Roughly two weeks ago AAAs national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline peaked just above $5. Granted it is still elevated but that price has fallen to $4.86 today. Taking one step further up the supply chain Gasoline futures peaked even further ago on June 9th and have fallen 14.5% since then. As shown in the second chart below that decline is now putting the past several months uptrend on the ropes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While both the national average and gasoline futures have been rolling over the decline in the latter has been far larger as those prices tend to slightly lead retail prices. As for the size of that disconnect taking the spread of the onemonth percent change of the two measures of gasoline is historically wide at 14.4 percentage points. The last times such a divergence has been observed were earlier this spring last fall and back in 2020. In those periods such divergences were shortlived. As shown in the bottom chart where we overall the AAA national average and Front Month Gasoline futures moves in the futures market tend to lead prices at the pump in other words it is unlikely retail prices will continue to fly in the face of lower futures prices. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Where Have All the Bulls Gone? gt; After two weeks of sub20% readings the share of respondents to the AAII sentiment survey reporting as bullish has risen back up to 22.8%. That increase in optimism comes on what has been pretty choppy price action in the past week as the Samp;P 500 had risen then given up roughly 3% since the last update of the AAII numbers. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The increase in bullish sentiment broke a streak of backtobacktoback declines and the opposite shift in sentiment could be seen for bearish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as pessimists fell by 12.6 percentage points in the latest week bringing the reading back below 50%. While the doubledigit decline was large the first week of June actually saw an even bigger drop of 16.4 percentage points. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The significant inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment have resulted in the bullbear spread to move higher but at 23.9 sentiment continues to heavily favor the bears. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In fact taking a fourweek moving average of the bullbear spread shows that the reading has been below 10 meaning on average bears have outnumbered bulls by at least 10 percentage points for 23 straight weeks. That continues to close in on the record sixmonth streak that ended in February 1991 as bulls are few and far between. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Given the drop in bears this week was far larger than the increase in the number of respondents reporting as bullish the bulk of the sift went to the neutral camp. That reading rose 8 percentage points to 30.5%. While that only leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of June 9th it was the largest oneweek increase since the last week of March and ranks in the top decile of all weekoverweek moves on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Highest Increases in Short Interest gt; As we highlighted in a post yesterday the relative strength of the 100 stocks with the highest levels of short interest against the Russell 3000 has broken its downtrend. This downtrend had been in place since the end of the meme stock mania in January of 2021. Just to refresh your memory that chart is provided below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Today we took a look at the 20 Russell 1000 stocks that have seen the largest increases in short interest as a percentage of float SIPF on a year to date basis. Leading this group is Upstart UPST the buy now pay later firm that has been decimated as growth stocks have gotten crushed and consumer confidence weakens to historic levels. UPST saw SIPF rise by 27.1 percentage points on a YTD basis and by an additional 2.0 percentage points in June. Notably UPST appeared on our Top 20 P/S Decliners list as well which we published yesterday. Unity Software U is the only other name to appear on both lists. The largest names on this list by market cap are GlobalFoundries GFS Ubiquiti UI and Rocket RKT. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The performance of these twenty names has been quite weak on a month over month and YTD basis. Additionally these names have massively underperformed the broader index since the end of the meme stock mania trading down by 48.7% on average median: 63.3% compared to the Russell 1000s loss of just 1.1%. On a YTD basis these stocks have shed 44.1% of their value on average which was accelerated by a 12.6% average loss since the end of May. Although its difficult to find any positivity in these names they are primed for short squeezes or reversals as shorts cover their positions which forces buying. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  3% Daily Declines in QQQ gt; Theres no questioning that markets have been extremely volatile this year. Yesterday the Nasdaq 100 tracking ETF QQQ declined by 3.0% which for 2022 has not been a foreign occurrence. In fact yesterday was the eleventh time this year that QQQ fell by at least 3%. Since QQQ began trading in 1999 this will be the fifthhighest number of 3% daily declines in the first half of the calendar year top chart below. Although the number of 3% daily declines is still well below 2020 and dotcom era levels it is still a significantly elevated reading. In fact this years firsthalf pace has been well ahead of levels from 2008 and 2009 and is only three shy of the pace in 2020. gt; Volatility has not been exclusively to the downside though. On top of the 11 3% declines there have been nine days so far in 2022 in which QQQ rose by at least 3% bringing the total number of absolute daily moves of 3% to 20. This too ranks fifth of all years since 1999 falling five short of 2020 and 31 short of 2000. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Of all 260 3% daily declines in QQQ since 1999 143 occurred between the start of 2000 and the end of 2002 the unwinding of the dotcom bubble. During this time QQQ fell a whopping 74.3% The chart below shows QQQ since 1999 with the red dots marking each 3% decline. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; QQQs performance following these occurrences is heavily skewed by the dotcom era weakness. While performance over the following week has been slightly better than average versus all periods since 1999 forward returns in the following one and three months have trailed the longterm averages. Since the end of the dotcom bubble burst 2003 forward returns following these occurrences looks much more attractive with QQQ averaging a gain of 44 bps median: 54 bps in the week following a decline of 3%. Over the following month QQQ has averaged a gain of 1.4% median: 1.6% and over the next three months has averaged a gain of 7.3% median: 7.2%. The positivity rates over the following week month and three months have been 57.6% 58.3% and 74.5% respectively. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Stocks with the Largest Price to Sales P/S Declines gt; Its no secret that there has been a massive pullback in valuation multiples and stocks that had higher multiples have been hit much harder by the recent market pullback. This comes as rate hikes increase the discount rate and the era of free money comes to an end which inherently lowers the risk appetite of investors. The chart below shows the price to sales P/S spread between the Russell 1000 growth index and the Russell 1000 value index. Naturally growth stocks should always trade at higher multiples but the spread became magnified throughout the pandemic. The spread peaked in midNovember 2021 at 3.7 but it has contracted by 1.8 points to 1.9 as of todays open. Whereas the growth index has seen its P/S ratio decline by 36.4% the value index has only seen a P/S decline of 13.0%. The growth index currently has a P/S ratio of 3.6 compared to 1.7 for the value index. The P/S spread between the two indices is now inline with preCOVID levels so the stretched growth multiples of the pandemicera have come full circle. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Dissecting this further we took a look at the 20 Russell 1000 stocks that have seen their P/S multiples compress the most since their respective 52week highs. Leading this group is Lucid LCID which has seen the P/S ratio decline by a whopping 275309 points. This comes as sales increased substantially and the price declined significantly 68.2% since the 52week high. Even still LCIDs P/S ratio remains in the stratosphere at 359. Next on this list is Norwegian Cruise NCLH and Carnival CCL which have experienced a similar phenomenon. Sales fell off a cliff for the cruise lines following COVID causing their P/S ratios to spike. As sales have returned on the reopening and share prices have continued to decline P/S ratios have fallen significantly. The largest decliners in share price since their respective 52week highs on this list are Upstart UPST DocuSign DOCU and Unity Software U which have declined by 90.4% 79.0% and 78.9% respectively. Upstart has seen its P/S ratio fall from 37.8 down to 3.0. The median stock on this list trades 10.8 times LTM sales which is still aggressive to say the least. Most stocks topped out either last summer or in October/November. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The six month price charts below are available using our Chart Scanner tool.

However if interest rate pressures subside and risk appetites increase these twenty names could benefit through multiple expansion. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Stocks on 7 Month Losing Streaks gt; The US stock market has been weak and in a downtrend since late 2021 and there are some individual names that havent been able to post a positive month in quite some time. Of all Samp;P 1500 members there are actually eight stocks with a market cap of at least $2 billion that are on a monthly losing streak of seven or more months. Six of these eight names are members of the Consumer Discretionary sector the worst performing sector on a YTD basis which is down 27.8% in 2022 as of Fridays close. The largest company on this list is Nike NKE which reports after the close today. The stock would need to gain about 7.5% through the end of the month to break its seven month losing streak. The average stock on this list would need to gain 6.7% through the close on 6/31 to break their respective streaks. Etsy ETSY is the closest to breaking its streak needing to gain just 0.9% while Under Armour UAA is the furthest needing 13.7%. On a YTD basis these stocks are down an average of 41.4% median: 35.0% meaning they would need to gain 70% through years end to finish 2022 in the green. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Below is a quick look at oneyear price charts for these eight stocks. You can click here to create a custom portfolio of these names if youre a Bespoke client. Unsurprisingly these stocks on 7 month losing streaks are trading in pretty steep longterm downtrends and theyve got a lot of work to do to get back to where they were trading late last year.

        "Buy QQQ now? Do you guys think it is a good time to buy qqq with it being down almost 30 percent YTD given that it has a 100 percent return over 5 years? Or do you think it is better to wait to see if the market falls further/ invest in another ETF or holding company?",

        "My guess: QQQ falls to 280 or lower if oil stays above $100 per barrel. Tough call but I think were more than likely going to retrace lower next week.

        "Ideal growth conditions for QQQX and XYLD? Under what conditions would qqqx and xyld grow the most? Selling covered calls monthly at strike price means that if shares go up too much you might get assigned and lose money. Or have to buy back the calls for a loss. Up just a little means you might still get assigned but you keep most of the premium as profit. Down just a little bit means that you keep most of the premium and dont lose a lot of value in shares. Down a lot means that you keep practically all of the premium but you lose out on your underlying shares for more than the premiums collected. So what is the ideal trajectory of QQQ in which they grow the quickest?",
        "7/22 Fridays PreMarket Stock Movers amp; News Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub Welcome to the final trading day of this week. Here are your premarket movers amp; news this AM  Nasdaq futures slide as Snap results weigh on technology stocks  gt; Nasdaq futures fell Friday as investors digested a fresh batch of corporate earnings that included disappointing results from Snap which sent social media shares reeling.  gt; Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 traded 0.3% lower while Samp;P 500 futures slipped 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 42 points or 0.1%.  gt; Those moves follow what has been a strong week for markets fueled by a rally in tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite is on course to close out the week 5.3% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track for a 2.4% weekly gain while the Samp;P 500 is set for a 3.5% gain.  gt; Shares of Snap plummeted a whopping 28% in extended trading after the Snapchat parent posted secondquarter results that fell short of analysts expectations and noted that it plans to slow hiring. The report was followed by a slew of analyst downgrades on the stock.  gt; The results from Snap weighed on other social media and technology stocks investors feared could get impacted by slowing online advertising sales. Shares of Meta Platforms and Pinterest fell 4.4% and 6.3% in the premarket respectively while Twitter and Alphabet each lost more than 2%.  gt; The Invesco QQQ Trust slid 0.58% after hours.  gt; Nearly 21% of Samp;P 500 companies have reported earnings so far. Of those 70% have beaten analyst expectations according to FactSet.  gt; The news could ruin what has been a hot streak for tech shares. The Nasdaq Composite posted its third straight positive session on Thursday. That came on the back of positive quarterly results from Tesla which popped nearly 10% on Thursday.  gt; The Nasdaq finished the regular trading day Thursday 1.36% higher to close at 12059.61 while the Samp;P 500 rose 0.99% to 3998.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 162.06 points or 0.51% to settle at 32036.90.  gt; Shares of growthfocused technology companies jumped in trading on Thursday as the dollar cooled down from its surge. The European Central Bank hiked rates by 50 basis points in its first increase in 11 years while initial jobless claims hit their highest level since November 2021.  gt; This is showing you that market expectations are really low that a little bit of good news can go a long way when you have low expectations said Truists Keith Lerner noting that investors rotated back into growth stocks even amid this weak economic data.

Ive lost a fortune on mega cap stocks micro cap energy plays financial tech discretionary Buffet plays value meme stocks short squeeze plays momentum earnings technical plays shorting SPY and QQQ contrarian etc.  Even followed a lot of trade ideas traders and theyve all been losers.  Im not kidding.  Ive lost over $1000 every single day this entire month.... consecutively.. no green days.  My entire portfolio right now is down ON AVERAGE 30%.  Some positions down 75%.  My best position is AMZN and thats down 25%.  Again these are not options.  These are shares.  Its ridiculous.  I am the antimarket.  10 years of savings gone in a month.  Im on the verge of suicide again but if anyone wants to get rich I am the ultimate indicator.    Seriously I will post my trades.  At least someone else can get rich.  I believe Im cursed but it would make me happy to make others bank.  Theres no indicator in the world that can beat my 90% track record.",
        "Why am I getting my first QQQ dividend only now? Been investing in QQQ every week since March I have about 1.77 shares. Ive never been paid a dividend before I didnt know I would be getting one from QQQ but I have one scheduled on the 29th. So why now? Why did it take months to start paying out dividends? Is there a stock within QQQ thats paying dividends?",
        "Dividend vs Growth portfolio Hi I am 19 years old and I want to enter the stock market for the first time. I am torn between investing into growth index funds and ETFs like VTSAX QQQ VOO etc. Or investing into income dividends like QYLD JEPI etc. i am considering putting my ROTH IRA into growth equity trackers like VTSAXQQQVOO and having my taxable brokerage account hold income dividend stock ETFs like SCHD QYLD etc. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I am very open minded to other investing strategies. I am young and have a moderate to high risk tolerance. Thank you Edit: by the end of the year Ill have around 35k USD to put in the market.",
        "SPY or QQQ in this environment? Curious as to what you would invest in today. I would like to continue building a portfolio of SPY but considering Im 20 I was thinking about buying a decent amount of QQQ first then buying SPY after I have a decent amount of QQQ.  My biggest worry is that I could still lose decent amounts of money. If I invested in QQQ in 2000 my investment in SPY would be worth more from DOT.com bubble. Does anyone feel QQQ is overvalued for P/E ratios?  Edit: grammar",
        "Advice on where to invest the rest of my savings budget Every Friday of the month I put $150 into QQQ. This is just a reoccurring investment that I have set up. I have an extra $280 to work with every month. What is a good stock that I should target?  I know I should be diversifying my portfolio but whats a good stock that is different than QQQ and still has consistent gains over the years? Thank you in advance.",
        "What could be next signal to end this dead cat bounce? I did not buy QQQ at 270 today it is trading at 320. I thought the missed earning season higher than expected CPI or negative GDP growth could end the dead cat bounce. But the market continued rising. What are some bad news in the future that could end this irrational dead cat bounce? Or should I just be patient? 2008 crisis also saw a pretty good bull run before it reached new low.",
        "Whats your thoughts on SQQQ right now? Looks like the QQQ is hitting a pretty strong trend line. Earnings have been not as bad as expected all things considered but the Fed has to continue raising rates and is just starting QT. Is this really the start of a new bull run? Or will we go back down and test the lows? Seems like SQQQ could be a good play in the shortmid term.",
        "Once Bitten by AMZN Twice Shy? My AMZN stock is over 50% of my portfoli  such was my confidence in it. The rest of my portfolio is QQQ and VOO. The recent bear market illustrated to me the danger of holding  heavily in one stock. And although my AMZN stock has now recovered just about in the green i feel things could have gone the way of META or NFLX not to say they wont recover too. So not sure if i should sell my AMZN and replace it with VOO. Is anyone else facing this dilema? I was first atracted to AMZN because of how good their website and customer service was but thats really not the case now and most of their value lies in AWS which i know little or nothing about. I guess its a bit of a risk vs reward gamble but being heavily in the read for 6 months has woken me up to the realisation that stocks really can go down as well as up and i think i will make the conservative choice. Do people agree that moving from AMZN to VOO is a good choice?",
        "Charting on ES/NQ amp; Trading SPY/QQQ? Hi Everyone Apologies in advance for the noob question. Tried searching but I havent seen a direct answer for this.  Wanted to know everyones opinion on charting/doing technical analysis on ES/NQ but trading options for example with the ETF SPY/QQQ instead of the Futures. Does anyone else do that? I notice a lot of people online do that when I was doing research and working on becoming a better trader. Is there a benefit to this? Thanks in advance. Appreciate any links to anything related to this.",
        "Are you buying at these levels? Hello all Cheers to the bull on recent market rally. I have been on sidelines since DecJan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping. Now everything is overvalued again. Forward Samp;P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900. I am not an expert but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However it does not seem we will revisit June bottom and that is ok but I am hoping for a pullback in Samp;P to below 4000. My current plan is to start small DCAing next week and wait until September most volatile month and before next fed meeting and start buying at lump sums if Samp;P 500 goes below 4000. amp;x200B; But are you buying not scalping at these levels? and if so why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing? amp;x200B; Disclaimer: I am long index funds and GOOGL. I also hold couple QQQ puts for hedging which got burned.",
        "Reminder to take gains on the way up Weve seen a huge rally in stocks over the past 3 weeks. QQQ is up from its June low of 271 to 333 currently. SPY pushed from June low of 365 to 429 currently. Many of the high flying stocks that make up these indexes are up over 50% in that same time period. Even ARKK has rallied from 36 to 52 in that same timeframe. amp;x200B; Many other high volatility stocks that were super hot a year ago are slowly recovering. This is a reminder to not get overly excited and start dumping allin life savings back into the market because of a potential bull market fomo. Dont make the same mistakes of the past. Dont forget to assess your risk profile and take gains on the way up. Theres no harm in selling some shares of a stock thats run up 50% in the 2 weeks. You beat the hell out of the market on the long term with that move. For example I love ENPH. I plan to hold it long term. But in the past 6 months its gone up from $140 to $300. Do I believe that ENPH is the future? Absolutely. But at a P/S of 23 and P/E of 200 its not a bad idea of selling a small portion based on your risk appetite to secure the gains and maybe move it into something more stable while you wait for more information to surface about the market and economy. Maybe I miss out 10% more gains. But if Im patient I can move it into a sector that has more value and higher chance to run up than cleanenergy. Maybe a stock in a sector that has the chance to run up 100% in 5 months like ENPH did. amp;x200B; Again all this is based on your risk profile. No one has a crystal ball but the only way to get rich on stocks is to actually sell at some point. Maybe selling small amounts of individual shares of fast moving recovering stocks that had great quarters ie. NET ENPH CRWD AMD will help free up some capital to buy more of them on the next downturn. No one can time tops of bottoms but just remember that taking gains is always a legitimate strategy. Even if the gains are small amounts. Take that money and treat yourself to something nice. Money isnt worth anything if you dont spend it on making your life easier or more enjoyable. amp;x200B; Last thing: the hardest thing to train yourself to do in the stock market is to sell into green and buy into red. Human psychology forces the opposite behaviour so you have to actively retrain your mind.",
        "Will We Ever See TQQQ  $88/Share Again? Title says it all.

        "QQQ TLT and bitcoin down big on Friday but oil stabilizing With the Inflation Reduction Act now passed there will be serious ramp up in government spending just like after the fiscal stimulus bill in early 2021. TLT treasury bond etf is probably going down to new lows. Oil is flattening and possibly is ready to rally. Oil company etf XLE is now stronger on the charts than QQQ. Bitcoin and ethereum got hit hard. Fed officials are still hawkish and will be hawkish even moreso if oil starts to rally here. I think the oil and gas sector still looks good.

        "A friend of mine is a long term investor. He showed me one of his investments. He invested $400000 into QQQ But he did this over 20 years and started with a $30 cost basis. My guess is that it wasnt until the last eight or 10 years of his career that he earned a sixfigure salary yet he will retire in 2 years with close to 4.5 million dollars invested. His advice to me was to invest everything into QQQ. His attitude is that it gives you action in the top marketcap stocks and investing in the top 100 is typically a very safe bet and will offer the best growth/risk balance. Thoughts? If I wanted to spread my money out between Tesla Amazon Microsoft Ford etc arent I better off just investing in QQQ?",
        "Head and Shoulders SPY and QQQ Surprised I havent seen any posts about the head and shoulders on both SPY and QQQ.  The neckline was broken last Friday and if we get a downside equal to the upside from the neckline then SPY should hit a minimum low of 392 and 293 for QQQ. Even if you didnt believe this was a bear market rally or in technical analysis a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline break is a rarity lots of people spot and bet on potentials but here we have the real thing even if on a short time frame. Personally I always thought this was a bear market rally taken to extreme levels of hopium and Im not sure the bottom is in.  But at least with the hamp;s Im pretty confident we have some more short term downside in the next few days.  And then of course after Labor Day we may get our annual September pull back on top of all this.",
        "Perspective matters  comparing swing trading vs buy and hold in between 2002 and 2022 I will make this post short and to the point: Good luck trying to beat the market by doing day or swing trading. I know people who try to do this full time who are smart and have the financial means to buy up tens of thousands of dollars of stock to try and buy then sell shortly after. Every single one of these people has a net loss from starting this. There are 14 of them I know  not a single one has come out ahead. Talk about not beating the odds. Here is the truth r/stocks folks: If you and I were bickering back in May 2002 that AAPL would be dipping from its high of $0.45 we would have been right. AAPL did in fact go down to $0.33 in July 2002. Had you bought puts on AAPL at the right time in 2002  yay for you. If you had tried to swing trade AAPL in 2002 you would have probably gotten burnt but maybe not. Listen: The fact is the best thing you could have done is to have poured $1000 into AAPL at anytime in 2002 and held for the next 20 years until today even with AAPL taking a dip recently. You would have more than 300X you original cash invested. We can do the same thing with the more conservative way of investing ETFs since most experienced investors on r/stocks like these more than individual stocks including myself. Let us take a look at a popular ETF you and I would know as SPY. SPY right now is worth $398. Sure SPY was at $474 back in December 2021 and man it should would have been nice to have sold then. . . April 2002 SPY trading at $119. December 2002 $87. My point with this post is simple: Buy hold and enjoy your life. I am not saying buy and hold crappy high risk companies. Pour 75% of your portfolio in things like SPY VOO and QQQ and dont touch them for decades. Hell dont even look at them. Current positions: 40% in SPY/VOO/QQQ ; 10% in SCHD ; 10% in VT ; 9% in AAPL ; 8% in GOOG ; 8% in SOFI ; 6% in TSLA ; 5% NVDA ; Approx. 4% remaining in cash. Buy. Hold. Live your life.",

I dont have a ton of money to risk",
        "20K gt; 100K In Two Months With Macro and Forward Thinking Did tons of macro economic research in the last two weeks stared at charts to watch volume and understand market sentiment checking 1s order sizes to see larger players enter or exit etc. I timed the top of the market when I saw AMZN  and the rest of the market do a quick jitter down on the day of the top. Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN QQQ SPY etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN with margin. Next day market started its descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because Ive lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole. I decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too since Im sure they would be greedy if the risk was low but they were ultra bearish. I place my 130P SEP 2 puts two nights before jackson hole unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didnt happen I shouldve been up $120k from the beginning. Anyway I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys were keeping the market up. The market shouldve been destroyed today with the sell volume but since the top side of the market is all wiped out there are now huge gaps in ask sizes causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day. Now ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600000 CAD with a 20% down payment : Which will be the equivalent to an $800000 house right now preupcomingcrash Thanks for listening to my story",

However since the inception of this ETF it has beat the Samp;P consistently. SPGP has 76 total holdings with the highest holding making up only 2.11%. I like it because it is not heavily invested in a single company and rather its spread out among many different great companies.   Any thoughts? Thanks",

And I vary the amount in each sector whether Im bullish/bearish with it. I think Energy is bloated? I sell a little and move it into a sector Im more confident in.

        "What will your portfolio look like when this downtrend is over? We all are pretty much in agreement that today was a bad day in the stock market.

Regardless if you disagree and think we will only be down another 5% or if you think we will be down another 20% I am curious of what your portfolios will look like when the hurting is over. If you do not mind me asking when do you foresee the pain stopping? I am biased with my views because 80% of the time Q4 in the second year of a presidents term are positive for many reasons that do not need to be typed here.

I see a lot of warnings that leveraged ETFs like TQQQ are better for shortterm investing but if you look at longterm charts such as the 10 year chart of TQQQ vs QQQ TQQQ seems to have massively outperformed QQQ in the longterm by multiple factors not including the dividends from QQQ. I feel like I have to be missing something otherwise far more people would be using leveraged ETFs like TQQQ for longterm growth but if I have money that I dont expect to use for decades and I am expecting QQQ to increase over that time wouldnt I be much better off with TQQQ?",

They dont like VOO as much either and no one should even talk about QQQ there. According to them VTI is better than VOO because its more diversified. But isnt small and midcap companies only around 15% of VTI. Historically both the ETFs have returned similar. During this bear market as well it doesnt seem like the small and midcap are helping VTI not drop as much as VOO. Infact if I checked it right VTI is down 20.27% YTD and VOO around 19.3%. So my question what do the small and midcap actually do in VTI?  Apologies if I missed something obvious. Thanks",

        "Just my 2 cents on what to do during all this selling off I am 29 so maybe I am naive and maybe I have just been lucky in the past. I did time March 2020 correctly with buying up stocks right before the very bottom. For context I bought up VOO QQQ W AAPL MSFT TSLA all on March 20 2020. The bottom was on March 23 2020. I did not care if I had caught the bottom. I just new when I pressed buy on my brokerage accounts that I had a discount on all of these ETFs and stocks. Did I get lucky to some degree? Sure. Maybe. I sold almost everything in August 2022 for a slight profit note that I sold everything in April 2022 and bought back in early July 2022: VOO AAPL MSFT TSLA. I am up this year while everyone around me is down. So my plan for this next week is to buy back up in mass quantity until I only have 5% of my portfolio in cash. I will be buying up VOO QQQ SCHD METV TSLA GOOG SOFI. I will consider buying up the following if and only if they dip another 3% the next week: NVDA V. So here is the dip people. This next week will not trade sideways because we just dont do that in the USA after a massive sell off like we have had. We will either trade up or down but not sideways. So starting Monday make your moves. Buy up ETFs and stocks you want to hold for years. I messed around with SQQQ and broke even twice this year. My 2 cents on inverse/short ETFs is to not touch them. You are truly better off just DCA into QQQ VOO and SCHD and buy more during dips.",

I set it to track buybacks as well as government contracts mass layoffs and some other stuff. This strategy can be rough around the edges but its been a unique way to find some companies to watch that I mightve never seen. 08/03/22RGA: Health insurance co dividend increase trade stock jumped pretty quick regret selling this one for 4% 08/16/22CCRN:Healthcare conglomerate bought on news of buyback sold a bit early here for 7% gain 08/30/22FREY: Traded battery manufacturer on day of news about a $3b contract beginning in 2025.

If I noticed the NASDAQ or Samp;P dropping by more than a few percent 35% I would buy the dip. I ended up exiting some of these positions but planning on keeping most and continuing to DCA looking at each trade individually for purposes of calculating return trade by trade. 08/22/22SPY: down 9% 08/23/22QQQ: sold on slight bump down 2% 08/31/22SPY: Positive few days after buying dip sold some SPY pushed towards 410 2.5% gain 09/21/22SPY: Sold after qqq climbed back above 300 after a dip 2% 09/23/22QQQ: About breakeven here 0% gain 09/30/22SPY: Little 5% gain here well see if this will change by end of week Total Return: 4.5% amp;x200B; TLDR: Traded for 60 days in a few new ways to keep things new returns below VGM Zacks 1 Rank List Return: 3% Trading Events LevelFields Return: 3.7% Buying the Dip Return: 4.5% SPY 8.2% QQQ 10.5% amp;x200B; Had some issues formatting so hopefully everything made it in accurately.

Its delusional. But as of now is it worth it learning more about the ratios?",
        "When will we stop hearing Nasdaq didnt recover for 15 years? To start with I love this sub. Most of the people are super nice and helpful. Having said that does anyone else think theres a lot of fear mongering here as well? Every now and then there are comments like If you had bought QQQ in 2000 you wouldnt have recovered for 15 years. The same person in another thread comments Past return doesnt indicate the future bro. Sooo which one is it? Cant we agree 2000 was a totally different time than 2022? It has been over 20 years since the crash but fear mongering is still there. Today 60% of QQQ consists of companies such as Apple Microsoft Amazon Google Nvidia Costco and more such. Are these companies similar to what we had in 2000? I dont think so. Also how would I l know I was 5 at that time. What do you guys think?",

Isnt VXF that tracks mid cap companies a good diversification to something like VOO? I was surprised to see the order volume on mid caps like VXF is very very low compared to the massive volume in Samp;P500 or QQQ. Is there something really off about this ETF? I was planning on keeping 10% allocation to mid cap but I am wondering if its a good idea or not",

        "Is investing in leveraged ETFs for the long term truly a horrible idea? I did the math over and over again and although there is always a chance of having a day where there is a 33% crash has not happened ... yet a person is not insane to want to hold TQQQ which is 3X leveraged for the very long term. If you invested $1000 in TQQQ in 2010 and held until now in 2022 even though we have had a horrible year so far you would still have over $25000 today. This is way better than holding in the typical QQQ or VOO in my opinion where you would only have $5800 and $2850 respectively. For years people on subs like this one and others similar subs have said do not hold TQQQ long term. Well if you had bought TQQQ in 2011 and held until December 2021 you would have over $100000. Sure nobody can probably predict when to buy or sell. Which is another reason I am thinking it is smart to buy and hold TQQQ for the long term. Tell me why a younger person like me should not throw $1k into TQQQ come Monday? Even if we have a bad recession like everyone is saying and that $1k goes down to $200 by this time next year I can just throw another $1k into it and then hold for a decade. Tell me if I am not seeing anything here? I used a backtest calculator to determine the above amounts for the simulation: ",
        "How would this have been bad? one year ago today I took a 401k loan of 40k in a very growth heavy portfolio and paid the loan in full Oct 12 IF one year ago today And paid off Oct 12 When QQQ is sitting down 30% ytd.  Im not understanding how this would have been a bad idea as I had the cash to pay loan plus any interest early.  My premise was that I sold all my stocks near peak suspecting a decent market crash after the pretty silly looking run up.  No rocket science just looking at reversion to mean.   Draw a line to where indexes would have been without the covid crash and subsequent bubble.  At the same time Id planned to take the max 401k loan of 40k at 6% interest or whatever it was and use that to sell a portion of the portfolio to buy back in later but without penalties or capital gains.   You could say it was timing the market but that was already my thesis for dumping all stocks.   Id considered rebalancing but didnt think bonds would do much better and wasnt worth complicated taxes with capital gains. Ultimately I did not take the loan as I didnt really need more cash had no large planned upcoming purchases and got rather distracted with other life events.  Is there something Im missing where in that time frame this would have ended up being a terrible idea?  Seems to me that would have netting 10k in my portfolio and if stocks rebounded from here about 20k.  ",

Once TQQ goes down below the 20$ I will than sell a covered PUT for 19$all this to collect premium from both sold calls and puts. OR 2 let my option expire Friday keep premium and hope QQQ doesnt below 18.50$ my new avg cost if premium is kept I hope this isnt confusing but is there a way to see what can statistically manage risk the best?

        "Is TQQQ a worthy investment? If you dont know what TQQQ is its a 3x leveraged ETF based off of the QQQ. Please do research if you plan to invest in TQQQ it is a very highrisk investment. Only put in what you can afford to lose.   Context   TQQQ has fallen from $90 at ATH to just $17 now. Would you guys consider this a wise investment going medium to long term? If QQQ hits $200 within the next couple of months TQQQ will be about $10$14. And realistically I dont see QQQ currently $260 going below COVID lows of $170.    I say this for a few reasons:   1 Inflation exists there is more cash in circulation now than in the preCOVID markets.   2 2020 COVID was absolute panic and we just arent there we know more about whats happening in our economy than we knew about some random virus from China.    3 QQQ has already fallen 35% TQQQ 81% from ATH and it fell 28% for COVID TQQQ 71%. The upside of the market outweighs the downside of the market within the next couple of years.    4 If you bought QQQ in 2010 youd be up 650%. If you bought TQQQ in 2010 youd be up 4000%. Across a long enough time horizon the market always recovers and TQQQ is more or less the same. So even if you dont time the market if you just wait your investment could easily multiply.    Okay so why is this important?    If you bought TQQQ at the COVID low and sold at ATH youd have made over a 1000% gain. On the contrary if you bought TQQQ at ATH and sold now youd be down 81% as previously mentioned. Even if you are a bear as long as the markets recover in some capacity within the next couple of years your investment could have a lot of potential as long as you average down slowly in the short term.    When could we see a pivot in the market?   Well Im no genie so I have no say in the matter. Although if you asked how could we see a pivot in the market I could answer. The answer is simple: when inflation cools down. I dont mean inflation has to be 0% I mean cool down as in there is a clear downturn in inflation that is enough to cause a FED pivot to decrease rates. Then people will be able to buy houses again which will stimulate the economy and so on. If I had to take a bold guess I could see this happening within 6 months because people are not buying things anymore like they have stimulus money this will help inflation cool because demand decreases prices decrease which will jumpstart the previously mentioned cycle.   What are the downsides?   Well lets say that QQQ falls to the COVID lows of $270 within the next couple months your investment would only be worth around $5. So yeah good luck gaining that back. It would have to over 3x to get back to where it is today which realistically would take a long time.    So with all of this said TQQQ would outperform the rest of the market if we see a green turn in the near future. Its okay to disagree with me for being bullish in the medium term so tell me your thoughts. Do you think TQQQ is worth it right now?   My position: 600 shares  $34.15",

        "Thinking of going back to 50% cash... The last week we had a good rally and my portfolio is up pretty good from where it was. I added 25% into VTI and QQQ and made gains in both. Now Im thinking of quitting while im ahead as my father used to say 50/50 i think is a good trade off for this environment. Tom Lee says he sees us hitting 4400 next month and maybe so but I can still make gains with the 50% in the market. The 50% cash will be added when opportunities arise either in certain stocks I hold or a broad index. For example if we fall in the next couple weeks to 3600 or so Ill put risk on in QQQ again. I think 3990 is a good high point to cut back. Yes we may overshoot to 4200 or above but Id rather have a good chunk of change to throw at a fall to 3500. These are very exciting and risky times. Lets all wish each other luck Were all in this together Good luck all",

        "The bottom is in. Just keep dcaing into indexes and in 20 years youll have a lot more money.. Easy The bottom is always in when your outlook is 20 years from now my friends The best way to make money long term is to keep buying in small amounts each week into and index. Ignore Cnbc Theyre in business to keep people watching. Yes you can learn some things and get a general market sense etcbut take everything you hear with a grain of salt Remember that the people they have on are usually trying to pump their own stocks or get you to go along with their investing thesisnot to help YOU but to make money for themselves. Thats just my opinion. Anyways I have about 20 good companies that I average down in but Im slowly coming around to the idea of indexing a larger portion and just dcaing. Some indexes I like are VTI QQQ QTEC IGV XLV IBB. Then I have mostly blue chips like UNH MSFT AAPL GOOGL NVDA LIN UNP COST ASML LRCX etc. But I think for the average investor with a 10 to 20 year look out the bottom is NOW. I mean by that that when you look back 5 10 and 20 years from now most indexes and good companies will be a bottom compared to where theyll be in those.time frames. So for the average investor seriously youre best bet to be successful long term is to pick an index or two not a sector but a broad index or two like say VTI and QQQ and just do a 50/50 weekly. For example if you inest $100 A week just put $50 into VTI  and QQQ each week and get on with life. Youre not concerned with what happens next week next month etc. You just keep buying So if you throw $50 into QQQ and its  crashes 50% next week .... awesome THATS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY Always keep positive and have a positive outlook on life. Keep yourself fit and as healthy as possible and dont eat a lot of junk. Try to eat as little as you can. Thats what I do now. I fast every day for at least 12 hours. So keep buying into indexes. If you want to mess with individual  stocks I think you should keep it to about 20% of your portfolio  and maybe under 20 positions. I also like to keep at least 30% cash right now but maybe I should have more of that cash in low risk stocks like JNJ etc. Anyways good luck all and remember that if youre under 40 you should just keep buying on autopilot into VTI or whatever. Dont woy about seeing RED in your portfolio.  You arent concerned with what happens short term and RED means you now can buy either your index or favorite stocks for cheaper",
        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022.  Dow tumbles 300 points Friday posts worst week since September  Source  gt; Stocks finished lower Friday with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points or 0.9% to close at 33476.46. The Samp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3934.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11004.62.  gt; On a weekly basis the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The Samp;P tumbled 3.37% while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.  gt; Fridays moves came after Novembers producer price index showed higherthanexpected wholesale prices which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI which excludes food and energy also topped expectations.  gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears but attention remains laserfocused on next weeks busy economic calendar.  gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.  gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Feds aggressive tightening stance but the data fails to support that desire said Stephanie Lang chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.  gt; Its our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers she said. Theres still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.  gt; In other news shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weakerthanexpected fourthquarter outlook.

Since 1982 DJIA has advanced 30 times during Decembers options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. Samp;P 500 has a similar although slightly softer record. gt; However the record is not pristine. Last year accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018 DJIA and Samp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011 Europes debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012 the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after. gt; Going into next week the markets bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%4.50%. Todays slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  More Positive Signs for Inflation gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022 and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest most important economic event of our lifetime aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday today well look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing. gt; First up the consumer price index was up more than 9% yearoveryear in June but has since come back to 7.7% and we expect the trend to continue lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people arent paying as much for stuff there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows services prices have been more stubborn but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43 cut in half from March. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year but should it turn lower it could be a nice tailwind. Although the governments data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year and the trend remains firmly lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month so safe to say this is a widespread trend. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Once again government data lags behind private data and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases while private indices consider just new ones. Also for the official data rental units are sampled only every six months given that rents arent renegotiated very often. For this reason we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 812 months. gt; Additionally CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% backtoback months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth. gt; Lastly used car prices continue to sink. According to their data the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down yearoveryear 14.2% the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices the governments data tends to be slow to get with the picture so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the governments data more over the coming months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared we think it could come back down in 2023 and things like rents prices paid and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This of course would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.  gt;  Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings gt; Sentiment tipped over before the Samp;P 500s rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This weeks reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% a reading in the middle of this years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Overall sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 SPY December Drop gt; The Samp;P 500 SPY has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally SPY did manage to move back above its 200DMA but it couldnt quite get above the past years downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today and while further declines could result in a break down it would also mark an impressive but not exactly unheard of streak of declines. As shown below it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact this months 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY since inception and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines both of those previous instances saw larger drops roughly around 4.5% than the 3.5% decline currently. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2  gt;  Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day. As shown below SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy XLE is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary XLY and Financials XLF. Utilities XLU is down the least so far in December at just 0.50%. gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The AllWorld exUS ETF CWI and the Emerging Markets ETF EEM are both down just 1.2% MTD and the AllWorld exUS ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence. gt; For most of the year heading into December we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks but recently as stocks have dropped bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month with the 20 Year Treasury TLT up the most at 4.35%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below of the yeartodate percentage change total return of the Nasdaq 100 QQQ and the 20 Year Treasury ETF TLT is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month QQQ is down 3.98% while TLT is up 4.35% but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  BacktoBack Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Chances are you have already heard about the Samp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest Samp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance followed by 8.0% in October 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable up 13.79% in two months. gt; Based upon the Bull amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Traders Almanac all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020 2009 2002 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish but choppy during the 1month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21year Seasonal Pattern for December. gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the Samp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 1520 trading days after the streaks end. Following this period the Samp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1year after the streak ended.ail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  When does the Santa Claus Rally Start? gt; As we noted on the blog last week December is historically a strong month for stocks and we dont expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the thirdbest month for the Samp;P 500 since 1950 April and November are stronger and thirdbest during a midterm year with October and November better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt; Taking things a step further though when does Santa come to town? One of the most wellknown investment axioms is the Santa Claus Rally and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December but this isnt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me given that this is when Santa comes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "TQQQ 3x leveraged QQQ is up less than the QQQ over the passed 5 years. Can someone explain how that works? I was just looking at the longterm charts and found this interesting. TQQQ up 67% QQQ up 77% over the passed 5 years. At the top QQQ was up 152% and TQQQ was up 682%. How does this work? Im an idiot I know nothing about how rebalancing works on leveraged ETFs. But perhaps is there an argument to be made that TQQQ is a smarter longterm buy than QQQ after the Nasdaq has had a sharp decline like it has this year? Interested in your thoughts",
        "Trading through volatile times .. 2023 I had a new thought last night that of course during upcoming turbulent markets when you expect that things may get bad its better to go maybe 80% cash and then trade with 10 to 20%. Basically half the battle in investing is preserving what you already have and not necessarily going for huge gains especially in crappy times. Yes you may miss out on rallies if youre 80% cash but I dont see any new sustained bull markets happening any time soon So my idea is this. Maybe 80% cash in money market where its totally liquid. Then I play my hand and gamble with very small amounts to very slowly add to my existing balance. Yes adding $500 here and there is not much but Im also preserving 80% of my hard earned money while others may lose 40% if the sp500 sells off in the upcoming months. My method is something like this. 80 to 90% cash in mm. Then I put 10% or whatever in QQQ. I wait. As soon as I gain $500 or so I sell and am patient again and wait for a sizeable drop. Maybe 5 to 10%. Then I reenter and do it again. This could also be done with a stock like aapl or unh or something. This way Im gambling with only 10% of my money and preserving 90% through a very volatile period that most see in 2023s first half at least. Either that or I just hold the QQQ with 10% and add little by little on large dips. So Im effectively preserving my 90% Maybe thats a bit high and then only 10% is sloshing around. If we go down 30% eventually  by February or March 2023 then I move more into QQQ . Maybe 20% more or something. Ride it up and then trim a little if we get back to present levels? Just an idea.",
        "TQQQ is now the time? I have 20k that I would like to gamble with. I have no need for the money in the foreseeable future and will have no problem waiting 510 years for the gains. Is this a stupid idea? Would regular QQQ be a better option in my opinion tech has nearly bottomed.",

As it sits Im down a little over $1k and I have a realized profit of $450 some from selling options some from realizing some gains.  I could sell some positions that are down and then buy into some similar etfs say move from QQQ to VOO.  This would avoid the wash rule because the investment is not the same I would erase my gains and get a deduction instead of getting taxed thus saving the tax bill and keeping my positions.  Do I understand this correctly?  Realize the loss to avoid taxes on the gains?  Im such a dummy and need to do more research just wanted some other people to point out how dumb I am.  Thanks.",

        "I Traded 3 Opposing Strategies for 60 Days in 2022 Heres How it Went I decided to run a short experiment for the last month or two testing out a few different strategies to mix things up. In no way did things scientifically this was more an exercise to ease some of my recent market frustration and trade in some different new ways. Here are the three different strategies and how they performed over the last 60 days amp;x200B; Strategy 1 Identifying Potential Trades with Zacks 1 Rank List: I used Zacks 1 rank list as my starting point and then filtered using the VGMvalue growth momentum score. I would sort to view only the stocks with a rating of Abroke this rule sometimes. I did this a few times and would do some DD on the few companies identified then determine whether to make the trade or throw it on a watchlist. Here are a few of my positions and how theyve done: 09/02/22 HLIT: 09/02/22  Communication/tech company sol after a few days for 9% 09/02/22 BAESY: European defense contractor that won some big contracts recently not much movement exited down 2% 09/13/22 CHK: Energy company play that was intriguing down 8% 08/04/2022 ESTE: Another energy play here held onto this one for 23 weeks for a return of 7% 08/05/22 HOG: Always wanted a Harley probably why this caught my eye  exited after 5 weeks for 10% 08/10/2022 PPC: food company down 19% on this one and still holding 08/16/2022 SU: Exited this one at breakeven in early oct another energy co from Zacks Total Return: 3% amp;x200B; Strategy 2: Trading events with LevelFields Trading on events definitely can be risky and my results here are surely biased due to the stocks amp; events I ended up choosing. I used LevelFields which I like because it filters down news to the events that are significant and likely to affect share prices and separates that from all the endless news. I set it to track buybacks as well as government contracts mass layoffs and some other stuff. This strategy can be rough around the edges but its been a unique way to find some companies to watch that I mightve never seen. 08/03/22 RGA: Health insurance co dividend increase trade stock jumped pretty quick regret selling this one for 4% 08/16/22 CCRN: Healthcare conglomerate bought on news of buyback sold a bit early here for 7% gain 08/30/22 FREY: Traded battery manufacturer on day of news about a $3b contract beginning in 2025. A day or two after took profits at 4.7% 09/07/22 TASK: Had been watching taskus for a while pulled trigger on notification of a big buyback. Up 5% in a few days and took some profits 09/06/22 COUP: Tried another buyback play here was able to get out even 0% 9/21/22 BA: Bearish event but thought Boeing could rally took loss at 8% 9/20/22 PLYA: Bought this on newsbuyback fell on news down 9% Total Return: 3.7% I enjoyed trading on events and after some early success definitely learned that you have to be careful as it can just as easily go the other way or an event can already be priced in or a hundred other things can go wrong. amp;x200B; Strategy 3: Buying the Dip This strategy is somewhat of my control and the least scientific. If I noticed the NASDAQ or Samp;P dropping by more than a few percent 35% I would buy the dip. I ended up exiting some of these positions but planning on keeping most and continuing to DCA looking at each trade individually for purposes of calculating return trade by trade. 08/22/22 SPY: down 9% 08/23/22 QQQ: sold on slight bump down 2% 08/31/22 SPY: Positive few days after buying dip sold some SPY pushed towards 410 2.5% gain 09/21/22 SPY: Sold after qqq climbed back above 300 after a dip 2% 09/23/22 QQQ: About breakeven here 0% gain 09/30/22 SPY: Little 5% gain here well see if this will change by end of week Total Return: 4.5% TLDR: Traded for 60 days in a few new ways to keep things new returns below VGM Zacks 1 Rank List Return: 3% Trading Events LevelFields Return: 3.7% Buying the Dip Return: 4.5% SPY 8.2% QQQ 10.5% Had some issues formatting so hopefully everything made it in accurately. Returns are calculated cumulatively counting return of each position at the time of writing realized or unrealized then summing the results. All position sizes for simplicitys sake are assumed to be the same size. Didnt do this to reach any significant conclusion with this tiny sample size did it more as a fun experiment next time Id like to try a fun inverse strategy off of certain pundits/analysts and or poor stockpicking services open to other weird ideas",
        "Tax loss harvesting etf I routinely sell calls against my etf position in QQQ. Last sold a call a week back. If I sell the qqq stocks at a loss and buy it a month later would it count as a wash sale due to me selling the calls?",
        "Humble opinion 2: Four signs market may have bottomed This follows my first humble opinion:  The fact that it received so many down votes is a good sign. I maintained the same sentiment: Bottoms reached for SPY and QQQ on 13 October 2022. Bottoms reached means that the 52w low on 13 Oct 2022 will not be significantly breached. Today I present four more signs that market may have bottomed using 2008 crash as a case study. All news articles listed here were published between February to March 2009 just before one of the largest bull market in history. Sign 1: MSM tells you all hopes are lost. Heres an article suggestion to millennials its better to become pirates piracy is the only growth industry left. Forget Wall Street You Can Be A Real Pirate  Sign 2: The most hated guy in the market is trying to doom the economy and you. Obama Declares War on Investors Entrepreneurs Businesses And More  Sign 2 alternative: The most hated guy in the market said he is trying to help the economy and you. Heres an example Obama was telling people to buy stocks literally just before the huge bull market. Obama: Buy stocks now  Sign 3: The Big Boys finally succumbed to cutting jobs. Heres an example. Bloomberg L.P. Cuts 100 Jobs a First for the Company  Sign 4: The wrongest guy in the market gets called out in anger except this time hes finally RIGHT.

        "Why not just use a stop Loss and rake in the gains? Ok so Im thinking of putting $20k in QQQ and raking in some gains. This is in my ROTH by the way so no taxes. Heres my plan. Put in $20k in QQQ and set a 5% stop loss. So for a little bit Im risking a 5% loss ..... no biggie. So I set a 5% stop loss and let it ride. So Ive gotta gain over 5% to have any type of gain. Once I hit say 6%  or so theres no risk anymore of losing a dime Of course I probably would wait to do all this when QQQ gets back close or so to its low as were pretty close anyways.

        "Why did the Dot Com Bubble Take So Long to Bottom Out? Im working on an analysis to determine a fair market value for the bottom of the current market for QQQ. I believe theres a lot of companies that have value in there and Im waiting to get a good deal on them. In the meanwhile Im looking to the past two significant downturns to better understand from a % likelihood when that might be. My first question is:  The Dot Com Bubble peaked around March 2000. It bottomed out in Sep 2002. Any ideas why it took so long? Was it due to Septmber 11 or the 2001 recession? Any other significant factors Im missing here. Did the enron situation have a major impact?  Another signal is the average time since the start of the downturn/market turbulence. In the last major recession the peak was around June 2007 and it bottomed out around March 2009 around 21 months.  Im also looking at the situation with the speculative assets in each of these major downturns as they have been significantly depreciated near the bottoms speculative tech stocks were down 90%99% near the bottom of the dot com bubble the Samp;P CaseShiller home price index was down 20% two years after the 2007 peak  Currently Bitcoin GME and NFTs have still not fully depreciated to 90%. Housing is still expensive while the price probably wont decline like it did in 2007 Id still expect a correction with the interest rates and layoffs. Anyways thanks for listening to me ramble. I work as a data scientist and I enjoy building quantitative models for hard to predict events. If you have any other data points you think might be relevant to perform a statistical analysis to find a market bottom that would be greatly appreciated Other Data Points Im considering  P/E future 12 months ratios  Moving Averages  Unemployment figures  Inflation % Whether it shows easing  Companies Earnings Miss / Expectations  Historical News Cycle Archives",

Theres no guarantees it will stay this way and you may see more tech companies listing on the NYSE instead of the nasdaq one day. I see some advantages to QQQ given it is technically a broad index and it has performed well no doubt. But are there better options than QQQ like MGK or VGT? VGT seems bad given it has 40% in two companies. Or are there other reasons you or other people you know prefer it? Edit: Im referring to buy and hold. Ive often seen people go 50% VOO / 50% QQQM",

        "Investment strategies for a large sum over 18 months  Seeking advice Hello everyone   Im looking for a strategy to invest a large sum of money over 18 months.    It looks like Im getting priced out of the housing market with these rate hikes. So my plan is to  invest heavily in the stock market over the next year and a half. Ill be using my down payment and most of my pay check every month.    My time frame is based on the average bear market being roughly 1 year and recovery being roughly 2 years. Along with DCA I would also buy dips of a certain percentage like 2% or something. So I expect my real time frame to be between 1 and  1.5 years.    I want to DCA the down payment into a growth portfolio like VTI and QQQ. So this would leave a large portion as cash in the beginning that would shrink as I invest. I want to do something productive with the unspent cash.     I was thinking of doing a second smaller DCA along side the growth DCA. The second smaller DCA would be a value/dividend portfolio. I would DCA into it over 12 months and DCA out over 12 months to get long term capital gains tax rates. I would start to exit the value portfolio only if I was in the green and then DCA into the growth portfolio.    Im building a spread sheet to work out the details. But I was hoping for constructive criticism or advice.    Is my plan a good one? Are there better strategies? Any and all input is welcome.   Thank you for your time.",

Im very bullish on tech but I dont want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their moms have a different feeling on where the economy is heading but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info and that as of right now is that rates will go up probably beyond 3% and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with Chinas economy Covid/MP Supply chains Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.   So my question is what stocks individual or sector based ETFs do you believe will perform within the next 23 years as rates rise to 3%?   Ive done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow   My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy for now is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks most notably BAC.   My third pick would be a suite of DSF Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher inflation they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years the P/Es are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.   My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin Raytheon and Boeing.    To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV Tracks price of silver and GDX Gold Miners ETF along with UNH stock which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.   My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials 15% Defense/Aero 20% Precious Metals 10% Healthcare UNH   10% In Wells Fargo 10% XLF 20% Financials 5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials  Consumer Credit 5% Silvergate Capital this carries the highest risk in my opinion but Im bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.   5% BA 5% Raytheon 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace   10% SLV 10% GDX  20%  Precious Metals/Commodities   10% UNH stock  Healthcare   After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months Ive found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market technology would be going up or down but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks inflation and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldnt find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97 a share after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening and I dont want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear I want to make decisions based off a trajectory thats most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses as well as adding defensive stock like LHM RTX and Boeing which I think will have always been great names but now was the time to add to them for exposure.    I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me so a small update and where Im invested now.   20% BRKB  10% QQQ  10% VTI  10% VIG  10% HYG  20% GDX  20% ICLN   I do enjoy holding individual stocks but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio after maxing out to 20500/year and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETFs I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing Im financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.   I dont expect people to read this far but if you do what are your top stocks/ETF sector specific for the next 2 years and why?",
        "Stop Loss  Whats your ideal %? Knowing that many people suspect we could be in a bull trap what are you setting your stop losses at if any for your longer term/index fund investments VOO VTI QQQ etc.? Do you have a onesizefitsall % that you use or does it vary depending on the circumstances?",
        "Comparing ETFs total return The BIG question all the time: is it better to focus purely on dividends or should I aim for ones that offer both dividends and growth or pure growth? I took popular funds from three categories: High Yield Dividend and Growth ETFs and put them in a virtual portfolio as if I bought one share of each ETF 10 years ago.  List sorted by total return that includes the difference between the purchase price and the current one and dividends received without reinvesting. IRR is the average annual return calculated by the formula XIRR. Then I did the same but for a portfolio with a 5year history and added SPYD NOBL SPHD DIVO as they launched in the past 5 years.  Heres 5year benchmark for QQQ and SCHD with DRIP  My personal answer to that question  different tools are needed for different purposes. But for some reason many investors are looking for growth in dividend ETFs and cash flow in VOO.

        "Overinvested in AMZN. Help me diversify A large portion of my taxable income is in the form of AMZN stock grants over many years. I wish I could live the easy boglehead life of VTSAX and chill but I am overconcentrated in this one stock against my will so I need to manually pick stocks and ETFs that diversify/hedge against AMZN performance.

But picking stocks is hard. What market am I missing? How can I better counterbalance against a large AMZN holding? I believe AMZN is a good investment but Im an engineer not a day trader and I really only need to do as well as the rest of the market. Other notes:  No I cant buy AMZN puts. Company policy. And Im not going to short QQQ. Stop. Im looking for basic diversification help.   I own a house so Im staying away from REITs and housing marketsensitive stocks. Im overinvested in real estate too.  I would love to hear about tech stocks and consumer discressionary stocks that dont follow the price AMZN. This is the most difficult place for me to invest. I own some TXN because IoT is the future and a little SHAK because hamburgers are delicious but not much. I keep these bets small. I wish I could find something profitable and anticyclical with AMZN in these sectors.   This is a problem with my taxable accounts. My IRA/401k accounts are lowexpense target date funds and I dont think I need to change them.  I buy the max amount of Ibonds and I dont need any more bonds in my taxable accounts.  I am 40 and I dont need to cash in my taxable accounts over the next decade.",
        "An ETF that performs as well as AAPL? As the title says Im a bit heavy in AAPL and looking at ETFs to diversify into for a bit of safety. Im leaning toward QQQ but looking at annual returns it almost never beats AAPL. In fact it seems like almost every one I look at underperforms when compared to Apple. Im realizing Im kinda married to this stock and its hard to let it go for anything that doesnt perform as well. Also because of their behemoth size many most of the major ETFs I look at are already heavily weighted in Apple so its hard to feel like Im really diversifying. I suppose one advantage would be that hopefully the ETF would be automatically rebalanced if apple ever had a sudden downturn. And perhaps rebalanced to more bonds in a major marketwide downturn although Im not sure that would happen with something like QQQ. Im just not exactly confident what to do and thought surely people have been in similar situations and was curious what they did and how it worked out long term etc.. Or should I just keep holding apple?",

It seems like a lot of people like things like VT VTI VOO QQQ that Samp;P thing AAPL MAFT GOOG etc. I am thinking of choosing something like VTI VOO Samp;P. It looks like people think that VTI is better than VOO because it is more diversified and that the Samp;P thing is better than VTI. I have about 2.3K to my name but I only want to invest a couple hundred at the start because I have no job so cant get that money back very quickly if I lose it all. Ive combed through comment sections and have looked at the Wiki but I decided to try and post since my financial situation is probably quite different to that of other peoples. The Samp;P thing is quite a lot of money so I dont really want to invest in it yet. I am currently thinking of going with VTI. VTI is also a lot of money but is about half of the Samp;P thing.

        "What are the downsides to investing in a growth covered call ETF like XYLG or QYLG? Ive seen many posts discussing the downsides to the regular covered call ETFs like XYLD and QYLD but I havent seen many posts discussing the growth versions of these ETFs. I was wondering what the downsides would be in this case? In the growth versions of these ETFs they sell covered calls on 50% of the underlying rather than 100% leaving room for upside growth. Sure it wont have as much upside potential as traditional index ETFs like VOO and QQQ but you wont be missing out on as much as XYLD and QYLD and youd also receive the monthly dividends which have the potential to increase in value with the natural growth of the ETF. It seems like the perfect vehicle to invest in if youre willing to sacrifice a bit of upside for the monthly dividend and decent compounding. Anything I might have missed?",

        "Making profits off of the hardships of inflation across the world Inflation actual inflation is going to hurt different countries in different ways. Some countries like the United States have inflation hit around 8% and begin to take action to try to control it. Other countries like Turkey have inflation soar over 50% and pour gas on the fire to make inflation jump to over 80%. Inflation cannot be kicked down the road forever and the reality and the math eventually catch up. A person can make money knowing this and how to play it. I am on here giving you my thoughts on what to buy what to do and when to do it. What to buy: EUO ProShares UltraShort Euro. What to do/When to do it: Buy up now because this will make you money in the mid term 39 months. What to buy: PSQ ProShares Short QQQ ETF.

        "ProShares UltraPro QQQ TQQQ  Should I invest? As I had already told the TQQQ could be very dangerous. TQQQ is a new paper never was in the real falling market space so I took the old data of NASDAQ from 1998 and simulated the TQQQ paper movements VS Nasdaq index full analysis The output was a disaster from March 2000 to October 2002: 1. NASDAQ 100  was down 75%. 2. TQQQ  was down 99.75%  Totally wiped out. amp;x200B; Lets take the numbers from today October 2021  September 2022 1. NASDAQ 100  falling 28%. 2. TQQQ  down 70%. The numbers are total disaster. If NASDAQ will fall another 28% the TQQQ will be cleared with total 91% fall. In today market condition when  FRS is tightening the money supply the market will continue to fall and TQQQ will destroy many peoples lives. I see a lot of posts about how TQQQ is low today and how great it will be to invest in it right now People you do not understand mathematics. The fall isnt deep enough.",

        "QQQ Downside remaining? 34% vs ATH How much downside is really left in the NASDAQ tech index at this point? QQQ is down 33% YTD and similar amount versus the all time highs at $404 Another 15% drop to $230 would mean a 45% decline from ATH despite a strong economy and good fundamentals for the constituent companies in the index. Such a fall would represent a greater bust than the GFC 40% in QQQ without any crisis to speak of and much stronger fundamentals. Yet this 1015% downside is exactly what many market analysts and consensus forecasters point to in terms of valuations going forward. Is it just me or does something not equate here?

The Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates higher and higher and is seeming to not have very much effect in the economy as of now.

Aside from that inflation has barely budged unemployment is back at historic lows at 3.5% and inflation is still very high. It doesnt seem like businesses stocks have said announced negative effects from higher interest rates is this mostly true overall? Is the stock market really down 24% prior to any real effect from higher interest rates entering the economy or is there another reason? It seems like a 2 part process.  The fear of all these rate hikes scaring the market.  Then the rate hikes finally showing real economic effects on businesses that inevitably bring the stock market another leg lower?

        "Is being behind on retirement savings a reason to be more or less aggressive? Basically the title. Im in my late 30s with virtually nothing put away except a few grand Ive put in an IRA this year. Finally earning enough and have enough months bills in savings  to try and play catch up. I can realistically put 1015k a year into an IRA or Roth for the foreseeable future and in another 9 months one of my employers will have a 401k available. That job is less than a third of my income so that 401k is a great benefit but probably wont be a huge amount. Im leaning towards being super safe with about 10k a year and whatever I can put away on top of that being a bit more aggressive with? Does that seem reasonable? Should I be treating every dollar conservatively because I cant afford any losses? Or should I be more aggressive because whats the point of having some retirement money but not nearly enough when Im in my mid 70s and I cant do this work anymore? Obviously theres no exact answer but Id really appreciate some feedback. Also my idea of aggressive here is high dividend REITs maybe JEPI or something like QQQ thats so beaten up right now I feel like there has to be long term value. Maybe some in companies like Intel which I did get some shares of when it was at 26 so yay me on stashing some there thats up 15% and will pay a dividend. Im not talking about trying to make up for lost time gambling thousands on options or penny stocks. My idea of conservative is put it all in VTI maybe some in SCHD.

It represents 500 most commonly traded large cap fund that has more than 11.8 b market capitalization. The distribution is Gaussian. / 1 sigma covers only 68% of the population not all 100%.

        "Which benchmark do you like more for a long term hold? Samp;P500 or Nasdaq 100 in a tax free account? Hi Id like to invest some money into a tax free savings account and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on what might be a better long term hold.  I already have both indices with about 65% in the Nasdaq 100 and 35% in the Samp;P 500.  Which of the two indices do you like better? Option 1:  Samp;P 500 with a long term hold VOO/SPY/VFV Option 2: Nasdaq 100 with a long term hold QQQ/XQQ which one do you like better for a long term hold and what percentage or allocation would you do? Right now Im more heavily weighted in the Nasdaq. Thanks.",
        "Taxable Account  Dividend Types I recently noticed SPY QQQ and DIA are considered nonqualified dividends for this 2022.  However in 2021 SPY and QQQ were under my qualified dividend bucket from fidelity.  Does anyone know how qualified amp; nonqualified are determined AND / OR noticed the same classification?  I invest a large chunk in these etfs via my taxable account so somewhat concerned having them here for the next 20 years.  Thanks.",
        "Follow an ETFs daily holdings I have been downloading daily holdings from ARK SPY QQQ XBI etc to check if theyre buying/selling anything specific.

Also I have seen some ETF day trade or hold positions for a short time and then sell. Does this mean anything? Generally is it a good idea to follow a particular ETFs trade moves?",
        "Why would a covered call ETF anchored off of a base index be down significantly compared to a straight ETF of an index? I think I know the answer to the question  but wanted to hear any other possible considerations that had not occurred to me. Obviously you can buy something like QQQ  which more or less will track exactly with the Nasdaq index ... and you ride the ups and downs accordingly.  But theres a new category of covered call ETFs out there which ostensibly aim to preserve capital and get high dividends  up to 10% on some of them. Thats not bad for someone nearing retirement if they have $1m to invest.   Inflationary considerations aside you could put it in a fund like that ... get roughly $8000 in dividends pretax every month for the rest of your life. QYLD is one such fund that as been popular lately.  So I thought to myself huh ok so what if someone put $1m into QYLD 5 years ago ... where would their capital be and what would their dividend income be and started to run the numbers. But I hit into a brick wall pretty quickly with my theory namely this chart What the chart shows over 5 years is the Nasdaq being up 50% overall ... but QYLD being down 35%.  A whopping 85% difference is noticeable so I wanted to consider what I might be thinking of before spending any more time in it. In theory if theyre trading well ... theyre writing covered calls which should expire worthless every month and thats what is giving them the cashflow to pay high dividends.  But using our $1m retiree example if they put $1m into QQQ in 2018 theyd have $1.5m now at the end of 2022 ... but if they put $1m into QYLD in 2018 theyd have about $650000 now  whatever the dividend payouts have been over that time. I would have hoped that ideally the $1m from the beginning would have at least stayed somewhat close to $1m maybe / 10%.  But 35% is pretty stunning.  Does this just mean that theyre not executing well enough on their covered call strategy?  Again I do still need to dig up the s for 5 years of dividend payouts to add those figures in but I would have assumed for at least protecting that $1m nest egg ... the underlying asset QQQ would have done enough of that ... and I actually expected that QYLD would have been up over the past 5 years because QQQ was.  But its not. Thoughts?",
        "For holders of QQQ whats the risk that the next big company isnt listed on NASDAQ? Although its very likely the next big company will be in the technology sector is there any reason to assume it will be listed on NASDAQ instead of NYSE or stock exchanges in other countries like China or UK? Or simply what happens if NASDAQ go bankrupt and Apple and Google etc. decides to switch exchange? How plausible is this scenario?"

One thing they had in common Large cap value high dividend yield. I will use MRK as an example. Hit all time high of $94 while SPY bottomed out. Samp;P then began a nice bounce while MRK pulled back almost %10. Friday at the close there was a bunch of selling across the market.

        "SPY is still 21% above prepandemic highs. Does anyone remember the prepandemic highs when everyone was saying the market was in a bubble and that market could crash upwards of 30% without a pandemic. well we are still 21% above that level even though interest rates are only getting higher inflation is more than triple what it was back then and not to mention were still in a supply chain crunch. With Interests rates and inflation only going higher and recession closing by the market could still crash another 20% and still be overvalued. BUT and this is a big but it still makes sense to buy solid blue chip stocks even in this market. MSFT GOOG AAPL AMZN are all great stocks that can wither a recession and potentially even grow in it so DCA into blue chip stocks is always a good choice in a long term perspective and so it only makes sense to keep buying the dip because chances like these are far and few in between.

        "No metric matters but Federal Stimulus and/or negative rates If the situation with not just the U.S. but global economy is that there is no growth without negative real rates because the currencies themselves have no value without constant debt pulling them through the system then what do P/E ratios matter if they can be obscenely high for over a year just because rates were zilch and money was printed? And I am not constraining this to just the past 2 years.  This dates back to when real rates went negative back 08.  So does any TA or earnings season even matter?  Because to be brutally honest Q1 earnings werent that bad.  And there hasnt been this wave of revisions on guidance. What are we actually trading here?  What will you miss out on if you just wait for the printer to turn back on?  Does anybody even care about actual price discovery based on fundamentals?  Do the people handling your 401 realize this?  Because if the prices actually reflected sentiment anchored to fundamentals alot of companies like XOM should not be having diaper filling days like this. It seems that you can basically disregard this reality at your own risk.  You can DCA all day and night into SPY but all it appears to be is your tax money and printed vapor being handed back to you.  And its pointless to look at historic levels.  Its now obvious that the GFC and the following decade plus was likely mostly if not all vapor.  The valuations have stagnated in situations or dropped entirely when they actually have to compete with Bonds that are still negative at this point. Its crazy considering how big some companies are and how much they provide.  Its beyond just dismissing it all as the market is not rational. That is fine I accept that.  But this isnt just about the markets ability to be rational. This is about the global economy as a whole and what wealth really is.  Are securities even assets if the companies they represent are just conduits for fake money to the investors? Does debt matter when entire manufacturing and resource bases were exported and there is no will to reinvigorate them?  Does being green matter if you cant provide heat and electricity in the winter?  And you arrest people when they start burning their cash and the trees around their houses to provide heat because there is no gas?  And on that same vein does it matter if you want to go green but you have no desire to look for and provide the resources needed to do so out of your own natural resource reserves? I am not looking to argue or anything.  I am just sitting here philosophizing watching all but my dinky little EUO and UUP trades go red which ironically are green due to a dollar that now requires six of itself to buy a dozen eggs being stronger than any other asset on Earth despite no tangible backing beyond an inept government and a giant military. Would a theory that time in the market is bad unless the Fed is printing work historically over the past decade?  Because the last few times rates have been attempted to be raised this is what happens.  And now theres commodity shortages exacerbating the price of normal QoL.  Where we already see some absolutely ridiculous policy starting: The Bank of England is raising rates while SIMULTANEOUSLY handing out money via vouchers.  I am not an economist but I did take micro and macro in college in the early 00s and the more I see actions like this and at all costs mentality the more I am confused by how there is no accepted policy anymore.  Its just kneejerk and rampant idiocy that runs directly contrary to even the most basic economics taught.",
        "DCA vs Dont fight the FED Im sitting on a lot of cash that I wanted to invest in case of an event like this into SPY. Im hearing two strategies here that make a lot of sense: DCA during the dip and dont fight the FED. But it seems these two contradict eachother. In case of DCA I buy every week/biweekly/month all the way down and up. The advantage being you take emotion out of it and you cant miss the bottom. Disadvantage: you leave possible gains on the table with the shares you bought more expensive on the way down/up. In case of dont fight the FED you wait till the FEDs start cutting interest rates and you lump sump everything at once. Advantage: Possibly more gains because you bought everything closer to the bottom. Disadvantage: you might miss the bottom plus it takes a lot of balls to lump sump a significant part of you life savings while keeping an emergency fund all at once. What would you guys do if you were me? Start DCAing now or wait till we here some positive news from the FED?",

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 20th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 20th 2022.  Look for more selling pressure next week as investors learn the hard way not to fight the Fed  Source  gt; Wall Street and the Federal Reserve appeared to enter a new reality this week and the result for investors was big losses with no obvious end point in sight.  gt; The Samp;P 500 is on its way to its 10th down week in the last 11 and is now well into a bear market. On Thursday all 11 of its sectors closed more than 10% below their recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 30000 for the first time since January 2021.  gt; Unlike recent drawdowns for stocks however the central bank will not be putting a bottom in the market. Instead the Fed raised interest rates by threequarters of a percentage point on Wednesday  its biggest since 1994  and signaled continued tightening ahead. Powell will testify before Congress next week and is expected to hold firm on his plan for a more aggressive Fed until inflation is brought to heel.  gt; Bank of America equity strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note to clients on Friday that it is time for investors to stop fighting the Fed and give up the buythedip mentality.  gt; In a bear market heroism is punished. Valor is unnecessary and cowardice is called for in portfolio construction  that is the way to preserve capital and live to fight another day waiting for the next central bank panic and better valuations and a new earnings upcycle Kapur wrote.  gt; Tech stocks which are sensitive to interest rates have been hit particularly hard as have cyclical plays such as airlines and cruise lines.  gt; But the dramatic declines have not been limited to stocks. B/itcoin dropped more than 30% in a week amid reports about blowups of c/ryptofocused trading firms. Treasury yields which move opposite of bond prices have spiked.  gt; Markets briefly rallied on Wednesday afternoon after the Feds announcement but that optimism was quickly dashed and the gains reversed on Thursday. Many strategists are warning that markets and sentiment could have further to fall pointing to Wall Street earnings estimates that curiously still show solid growth in the coming year.  gt; These people need to fight inflation as fast as possible and as hard as possible. And the market has consistently been behind the curve on trying to understand how aggressive this Fed was going to be said Andrew Smith chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors.  gt;  Recession ahead? gt; The impact of the Feds rate hikes on the market has been magnified by deteriorating economic data as investors and strategists appear to be losing confidence in the central banks ability to achieve a soft landing.  gt; The housing market appears to be cooling rapidly with housing starts and mortgage applications plummeting. Consumer sentiment is plumbing record lows. Jobless claims are beginning to trend higher as reports of layoffs at tech firms grow. And all oil prices show no signs of falling back below $100 per barrel as the summer travel season kicks off.  gt; In a note to clients on Friday Bank of America global economist Ethan Harris described the U.S. economy as one revision away from recession.  gt; Our worst fears around the Fed have been confirmed: they fell way behind the curve and are now playing a dangerous game of catch up. We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero inflation to settle at around 3% and the Fed to hike rates above 4% Harris wrote.  gt; Even among more optimistic economists the outlook calls for a rather bumpy landing. JPMorgans Michael Feroli said in a note Friday that he expected Powell to be largely successful in balancing fighting inflation with economic growth but a recession is a distinct possibility.  gt; This desired soft landing is not guaranteed and Fed chair Powell himself has noted that achieving this goal may not be entirely straightforward. And with a tight labor market and the economy dealing with the shocks of tighter financial conditions and higher food and energy prices recession risks are notable as we think about the next few years Feroli wrote. Our models point to 63% chance of recession over the next two years and 81% odds that a recession starts over the next three.  gt;  Coming up gt; Powell will be in the hot seat again next week as he returns to Capitol Hill to testify before both houses of Congress and he is unlikely to soften his stance over the weekend.  gt; The Fed Chair said on Wednesday that he and his committee members were absolutely determined to keep inflation expectations from rising. The central bank said in a report to Congress on Friday ahead of the hearings that its commitment to price stability is unconditional.  gt; Inflation has risen to a top political issue as well as an economic one and the Feds raised forecast for unemployment could also come under scrutiny from lawmakers.  gt; As theyre going to 2.5% 3.5% Fed funds rate if the economy is slowing toward a recession I dont think theyre going to stand on the throat of the economy to get inflation to go down said Robert Tipp chief investment strategist for PGIM Fixed Income. ...Otherwise in order to get inflation down from 3.5% to 2% youre going to have to lose your job. Thats going to be the message: Were going to have to get some job losses and recession. And I dont think that tradeoff is going to be worth it for them.  gt; On Friday investors will get an updated consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan. That measure has now taken on increased significance after Powell pointed to it this week as one of the reasons the Fed decided to raise its rate hike this month.  gt; The surveys preliminary reading for June showed a record low for sentiment and confirmation of that number  or even further deterioration  would likely serve as further proof that the Fed will not waver in the coming months. The inflation expectations part of the survey which rose in the preliminary reading will be watched closely.  gt; Outside of those events next week is relatively light for economic events with U.S. stock markets closed on Monday for Juneteenth. Investors will be looking for insight into the U.S. economy in earnings reports from a few bellwether stocks such as Lennar on Tuesday and FedEx on Thursday.

On Monday the Samp;P 500 Index moved into a bear market finally closing 20% beneath the January 3 high. gt; Here are 7 things to know about bear and bull markets: gt;  Since World War II seven bull markets have officially doubled. The recent bull market was the fastest to ever double but it also ended much quicker than the others at less than two years old. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 2 The bull market that just ended lasted only 21 months from the March 2020 lows until the January 2022 peak checking in as the shortest bull market since WWII. As noted above though it was also the quickest to ever double. Wow. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 3 Here are all the bear and near bear markets since 1950. This bear market is actually already old by recent standards explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. At more than five months old it is already older than six other bear markets going back nearly 40 years. Only the tech bubble and Great Financial Crisis bears lasted longer. gt; This could mean the bear market could be closer to a bottom than many expect. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 4 What could happen next? As we show in the LPL Research Chart of the Day the good news is a year after the Samp;P 500 moves into a bear stocks actually do pretty well up an average of nearly 15% a year later with a very solid median gain of 23.8%. gt; The catch and theres always a catch the returns a year later were negative in the 197374 recession the tech bubble and the Financial Crisis 20082009. The good news is we dont see an economy like that over the next year so the likelihood of higher prices maybe significantly higher is quite strong in our view. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 5 How quickly could stocks bottom once a bear starts? The data is all over the map here. It took only 11 days in March 2020 for the lows to form while it took 18 months after the tech bubble. Bottom line we think this could play out more like things did in 1987 or the 1950s and 1960s with the ultimate low taking place sooner rather than later. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 6 Looking at previous bears that took place without a recession still our base case showed that stocks tend to bottom at a little more than down 20%. Yes 1987 is in there but most of the other times stocks bottomed near where we are now suggesting potentially limited pain from current levels. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 7 Investors need to remember that since the Samp;P 500 Index moved to 500 stocks on March 4 1957 it has made 1184 new alltime highs and it has always eventually achieved new highs even if it doesnt feel that way today. Wars skyhigh inflation recessions bubbles 100 year pandemics geopolitical events policy mistakes and more have all happened over this time but stocks have always come back eventually to new highs. We do not think this time will be any different. As long as businesses can grow earnings over the long run the fundamentals are in place for future stock gains which means new highs could be coming as well. gt; They say the stock market is the only place things go on sale and people run out of the store screaming. Please remember that before you make any rash investment decisions. gt; Lastly the Samp;P 500 was just down more than 1% for four consecutive days. This very rare occurrence hasnt been fun for investors but be aware the returns after these painful streaks have been very strong higher a year later 9 out of 9 times with a solid 26.7% gain on average. Additionally each consecutive day saw a larger loss than the previous during the four day streak. That has only happened two other times in history in March 2009 and December 2018. Those werent the worst times to be looking for opportunities. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Market Prone to Late June Weakness gt; June is not a great month for the market in general. Its even weaker in midterm years. But the week after June Triple Witching is horrendous. Down Triple Witching Weeks also tend to trigger more weakness the week after. gt; But with Samp;P 500 down 10 of the last 11 weeks and down 11.3% to date which would be the second worst June ever behind 1930 perhaps some of the usual endofQ2 carnage has been pulled forward. gt; Any perceived improvement inflation Russia/Ukraine war or supply chains would be welcomed by the market. With the bear on the loose caution and patience remain the best course of action. Happy Fathers Day to all the dads Hit em Straight gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  History of bear markets points to an October 2022 bottom gt; On Monday of this week DJIA fell into an official Ned Davis Research NDR bear market. This raises the question Where can we go from here? In the table above we examine all the 13% DJIA declines after 145 days since 1948 and the subsequent action after. The four 30% Value Line Geometric reversal bear markets in 1987 1990 1998 and 2020 are included for reference. gt; Of the eighteen others only the two reached bottom at the 13% 145day decline 1953 and 2016. Eight were followed by further declines of less than 10% and eight greater. Twelve bottomed out less than three months later and six dragged on for 6 months or more. The average additional decline was 12.4% over an average of 139 calendar days. Based upon DJIAs close on June 13 and these averages DJIA could ultimately find bottom around October 31 2022 at 26732.13. This would represent a total bear market decline of 27.4% in 298 calendar days. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Sentiment Staying Low gt; More hawkish monetary policy and the Samp;P 500 hitting the bear market threshold have given sentiment plenty of reason to turn lower and thats exactly what has happened. After reaching a shortterm high of 32% only two weeks ago the percentage of respondents to the AAII survey considering themselves bullish has fallen back below 20% this week. That may not be as extreme of reading as those in the midteens from back in April but it is still a historically low reading and in the bottom 2% of all weeks going back to the start of the survey in 1987. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While bullish sentiment has declined this weeks 1.6 percentage point decline was actually much smaller than the 11 percentage point drop last week. An even bigger decline occurred for those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading fell 9.9 percentage points from a recent high of 32.1%. Now at 22.2% the percentage of neutral respondents is back down to the lowest level since the start of May. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; With both bullish and neutral sentiment falling the bearish camp picked up the difference. Heading into this week bearish sentiment was already elevated at 46.9%. The 11.4 percentage point bump this week means that well over half of respondents are now bearish with the current reading just 1.1 percentage points shy of the 59.4% high from the end of April. That ranks as the eleventh highest reading of all weeks on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; That also means the percentage of bears outweighs bulls by an astounding 38.9 percentage points and is the lowest reading since the last week of April. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Not only do bears outweigh bulls by a large margin but it has also been a historically long length of time that this has been the case. Smoothing out the reading by taking a fourweek moving average of the bullbear spread the average has been below 10 in other words on average over a fourweek span bearish sentiment has been at least 10 percentage points higher than bullish sentiment for 21 straight weeks. That surpassed another long 18week streak in 2020 and is now only five weeks short of the record stretch of 26 weeks in the early 1990s. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Not only has the AAII survey showed souring sentiment but so too have the weekly NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence surveys. This week the NAAIM index showed investment managers only have 32.2% long equity exposure. Meanwhile the Investors Intelligence survey saw the most negative bullbear spread in a month. Normalizing each of these three sentiment indicators the average reading is now 1.28 standard deviations from the historical norm. That is not as bad as last month but it remains a historically pessimistic reading on sentiment. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Asset Class Performance During QT gt; As mentioned in our piece from earlier today gold did not necessarily deliver superior performance during the last QT cycle. This leaves investors to ponder: which asset classes did deliver substantial returns? Is there anywhere to hide? Although the macroenvironment is vastly different this time around it is still helpful to look at past occurrences to attempt to put a frame of reference around todays markets. Major differences include rampant inflation particularly in commodities supply chain constraints lapping stimulus benefits and weakening economic data. Below we summarize the performance of the Samp;P 500 bonds agricultural commodities and oil during previous QT cycles. gt; The Samp;P 500 outperformed Gold during the last QT cycle gaining 19.2% which constitutes an annualized return of 10.1%. The graph below outlines the performance of the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY during different cycles of QE and QT. As you can see equities were not particularly steady during the last QT cycle but SPY gained significantly after the Fed announced its intent to slow the balance sheet winddown. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In the last QT cycle the bond market initially sold off but managed to finish higher for the entire period. The iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF AGG bottomed at a drawdown of 4.7% about a year after the cycle began but proceeded to gain 6.7% through the final 203 trading days of the cycle. When all was said and done AGG finished the cycle with gains of 1.7%. Similar to what we saw in gold much of the gains were seen after the Fed announced its plan to slow the winddown of the balance sheet. This suggests that rates rose at first but then reversed course when the Fed announced the impending end of QT. So far in the current cycle AGG has already dropped by 2.7% but bonds sold off hard in anticipation of QT in late 2021 and early 2022. On a YTD basis the ETF is down a whopping 12.7%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Agricultural commodities performed poorly during the last QT cycle dropping 15.7%. This constitutes an annualized return of 8.9% but the broader agricultural space was in a downtrend before QT began. Currently agricultural commodities are in an uptrend so it will be interesting to watch the price action as QT ramps up. On a YTD basis the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund DBA is up 10.2% and is essentially flat since QT began in early May. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; During the last QT cycle crude oil gained 15.8% but it would be difficult to attribute these gains to quantitative tightening. Since the Fed began tightening this year crude oil has jumped 16.0% higher. In the last cycle oil rallied higher before subsequently crashing which would certainly be welcomed by many in this cycle. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  DJIA is officially in a bear market gt; For years we have relied upon the Ned Davis Research definition of bear and bull markets. An official bear market requires a 30% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. The drop is measured from peak to trough and both price and time criteria must be met. At todays close it has been 160 calendar days since DJIAs peak on January 4 DJIA is down 17.1% and at a new closing low which meets the parameters. gt; Inflation is stubbornly remaining at multidecade highs the Fed is tightening sentiment is bearish support levels are not holding supply chain disruptions persist there is conflict in Europe and energy prices are at record highs for consumers. Continue to be patient as the Weak Spot of the fouryearcycle will eventually give way to the Sweet Spot likely sometime later in Q3 or in early Q4. Even with inflation at multidecade highs cash is likely the least dangerous place to wait.  gt;  Weak May Housing Data gt; Earlier this week we highlighted the fact that mortgage activity had fallen off a cliff due to a historic rise in rates. This is an important factor to keep in mind as the housing market tends to be a strong leading indicator for recessions as every recession besides the COVID crash since the early 1960s has been preceded by a pronounced decline in Housing Starts. Although the NAHB index has already rolled over substantially Housing Starts and Building Permits are yet to drop on a trailing twelvemonth basis. However the data has been showing signs of weakness as we have now seen two consecutive months of declines in permits and a significant monthovermonth fall in starts. gt; The table below breaks down this months report by type of unit and region and shows both the monthovermonth and yearoveryear changes. Contrary to what we saw last month Housing Starts moved higher in the Northeast and Midwest on a m/m basis while the South and West saw dramatic declines. On a y/y basis only the Northeast smallest of the four regions saw starts move higher. In aggregate Housing Starts fell by 14.4% month over month and 3.5% year over year. Although multiunits fell more than single units the decline was substantial for both. In terms of permits there was no positivity in sight as every region saw m/m declines. This is not a positive sign for future starts data as permits must be issued before starts can occur. In aggregate Building Permits fell by 7.0% month over month driven by a massive decline in the Northeast. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; For the first time since February of 2021 the 12month average of Housing Starts declined on a m/m basis. A rollover in this figure tends to be a strong recession indicator which based on prior history would suggest that the economy is not yet in a recession. If this data continues to weaken though. recession alarms will start ringing. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The charts below show the rolling 12month average for Housing Starts and Building Permits since 2010 on both an overall basis top chart and for singlefamily units specifically bottom chart. Overall the 12month average for headline starts and permits has experienced headwinds as of late with the rate of increase for both slowing down and starts actually showing a slight decline. The trend for singlefamily units however is much more divergent as permits have already started to roll over after peaking last summer while singlefamily starts have essentially leveled off during that same span. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies tickers reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Psychology of starting and maintaining a portfolio Hi its long weekend and just want to get some feedback on this thought experiment: Lets say you have $10000 and you want to start a new stock position you have done all the DD valuation and whatnot. So on a red day you put in the order how much do you typically start? 10%? 25% 50% or all in? As soon as you entered there can only be two outcomes  1 Stock goes up or 2 Stock goes down. How do you mentally handle these two outcomes? If you start with 10% and it goes up are you kicking yourself for not starting with more? What if it goes down are you kicking yourself for not waiting a little bit longer? After that we must decide on the next order. If it goes up do you chase it with another 10% or wait for it to drop back to your entry price? If you chase do you increase the order to maybe 15% or 20% since you missed the cheaper price earlier. If it goes down I guess the decision is easier obviously you can treat it as a discount but do you put in another 10% or learned your lesson and put it less like 5% since you paid the price of impatience in 1st round. As a pessimist it seems no matter what I do its always wrong. Could have bought more should have waited longer etc. I actually have a fear that even if Im lucky enough to catch the bottom I would still question myself why I didnt wait a bit longer or why I didnt find a bit more fund to buy more. How do you guys turn this hobby into a more positive enjoyable experience? For context I have bought SPY from $455 all the way to $363 now my average is $392. I didnt wait for the bottom I continue to average down or some call it buying the dip and increase the order size for every 10% drop and I only buy when the price is lower than my last purchase. So my trade days were 1st MAR 7th MAR 26th APR yes a long wait 29th APR 2nd MAY 9th MAY 20th MAY 13th JUN 14th JUN 16th JUN and 17th JUN. I supplement this with a small amount of UPRO whenever there is a deadcatbounce or bullrally and the UPRO turns green Ill sell it all. If I had waited for the soontocome bottom my AVG would still be around $440. Now Im comfortable that the loss is less than 10% and I will try to make sure SPY doesnt stray more than 10% from my AVG which means Ill continue to buy more lower. On red premarket days which are lower than my last purchase price I usually place orders of increasing size capturing 2% 3% 4% 5% and 6%. It will be quite nasty if SPY drops more than 6% a day and my orders will ensure I always buy the bottom and keep SPY within 10% from my AVG.",
        "Market Outlook 6/22/2022 Recap on yesterdays market action:  SPY closed up 2.52%  QQQ closed up 2.33%  Dow Jones Industrial closed up 2.15% Today was a good start to the market rally and recovery but we still have a lot of ground to cover before the bear market is truly shook. As for market news we still have the Fed Chair speaking Wednesday and Thursday and this may have an impact on the markets. SPY broke back above the resistance trendline support lines become resistance once they have been broken. Even though SPY broke above the line it did so on below average volume and started to fade into the close. If SPY can base above the trendline for a few days and then stage a rally that would be very productive. QQQ never broke below its support trendline however this does not mean that it is performing stronger than SPY. Today it was up on below average volume and also faded into the close closing about halfway through the daily range. Similarly to SPY if QQQ could base for a few days and then advance on volume that would start to signal a rally. GOOGL triggered a buy today when it took out Wednesdays high with volume. I considered opening a small position but missed the alert and by the time I saw it GOOGL had advanced approximately 1% past the buy point. Even if I had opened a position I likely would have sold partial shares 20% of position near the high and more shares 50% of remaining position when GOOGL came back to my buy point. This market is very choppy and thus makes take partial profits quickly essential. As of now GOOGL needs to take out the June 10th high with volume to be considered a buy. TSLA is acting slightly stronger that GOOGL at the moment. Also advancing past Wednesdays high with volume although we did see a fade into the close. Similarly to GOOGL I had planned to buy taking out the highs but missed the alerts I was occupied with a meeting. TSLA did form a downward sloping trendline that may provide an entry if it is taken out with volume and a good market. amp;x200B; Overall todays price action was constructive but no enough to become extremely bullish. This is simply one step on the long road to a health market. The indices may setup up for an entry but profits need to be taken quick and losses even quicker. As for individual stocks that show high probability setups they are few and far in between. My true favorites are currently only GOOGL and TSLA more may soon be added to this list. Stay focused and watch your stocks because the market has the ability to turn quickly.",
        "A market environment where indexing does not work? Ive been contemplating this for a while and Id love to get some other thoughts. Over the past 40 years weve had a macro environment where interest rates have steadily decreased for a number of different reasons. In addition to structurally lower interest rates the last 12 years were also an environment with effectively infinite QE. This low inflation QE supported environment is likely a huge reason why US tech stocks were able to dominate and have outsized returns starting in 200910. Money was effectively free making it easier to grow a business without needing to show immediate profits. This is largely what created the environment to support a Tech boom and higher P/Es. But as we know the top 10 companies of today are unlikely to be the top 10 companies in 10 years from now. With the macro environment now shifting away from unlimited QE and a breakdown of globalization theres a lot of talk of a regime change. I dont have the words for how important this could be for equity investors. A regime change is not a good thing at least in the short term and it could very well lead to a world of structurally higher interest rates the end of QE and ultimately a change in investor perceptions. If this regime change does happen and we are seeing the beginning of it and QE goes away for the next 40 years and interest rates normalize to 5% as they used to be before the 08 financial crisis Im wondering what that will mean for investors. Why buy a stock at a 20 P/E when you could buy a Bond that pays 5% guaranteed? All of a sudden the average P/E weve been accustomed to for the last decade is completely  unsustainable. An example of this during the inflationary bear market in the 70s the stock market got down to P/Es below 10x. Could you imagine what would happen to SPY if it went to a P/E of 10? People would say its the end of the world and investing is dead. I dont anticipate this will happen Im just putting into context what higher interest rates for longer will do to stocks and the higher interest rates get the lower P/Es have to go. So if we are going through a regime change due to higher for longer inflation and the last 40 years of low interest rates is over what happens to equity valuations and does it still make sense to index to something like the Samp;P? Would it make more sense to Index specifically to cash flowing dividend payers that are already priced below 15x P/E on average? When theres a real cost of capital and money is no longer free it seems to me that investors will prefer return of capital rather than return on capital. The idea of a regime change away from structurally low interest rates could make stock market investing extremely unattractive and the fact that broad market ETFs have become such a crowded trade over the last 2 decades in addition to the macro environment we had it just makes me think indexing wont be the free lunch it used to be. That doesnt mean I think we should all become stock pickers or bond investors. But it does make me think that the way ETFs are currently structured with high P/E Tech being the biggest weighting returns will be severely muted going forward. All of this of course is speculation on the idea that we are going through a regime change and interest rates will never be as low as weve seen them recently. Its easy for people to anchor to what the world used to be we saw this when Covid happened people thought we were just a 12 week lockdown away from the world going back to normal but it never did. I find it difficult to believe one day everything will just go back to 0% interest rates and markets will continue to grind up like nothing ever happened. I find it much more likely that interest rates are higher for longer and investors start to prefer different types of equities than the ones weve seen over the last 20 years which ultimately could lead to broad market ETFs being a dead investment for a long time at least until a new group of leaders emerges like the FAANG stocks.",
        "Market Outlook 06/28/2022 Recap on yesterdays market action:  SPY closed down 0.38%  QQQ closed down 0.73%  Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.20%  VIX closed down 1.10% The major indices all gapped up to open and quickly gave back their gains to close slightly lower on the day. Although many stocks closed down for the day this was still a constructive and much needed rest after last Fridays large gains. With that being said dont get overly bullish just yet. We still have a long ways to go before the market shakes off the past few months. SPY ran into the 21 day exponential moving average orange line right at the opened and quickly reversed. This was not an extremely strong reversal however with volume lower than Fridays run up and the average daily trading volume. What would be most constructive is if SPY ranged here for a few days to a week and then looked to advance even farther. SPY could also setup for a highlow by trending downwards slightly and then taking out todays highs. Conversely if we see strong selling in the next few days this may indicate more downwards action. QQQ behaved similarly to SPY however QQQ actually gapped up above its 21 day exponential moving average orange line but still closed slightly below. A week of range trading or even a slight downward trend would be constructive for QQQ as it would give some time before attempting a new advance. Recap on recent positions: Before the close on last Thursday I opened two small positions in AMZN amp; QLD. Both performed very well and Friday and today I was stopped out of both positions. My first shares of AMZN where bought at the pivot point shown by the yellow line. This was at the close of Thursday and as prices began to advance on Friday I bought a small amount of additional shares. Today I sold out of this position for a moderate gain of 1.80%. This is not an eye popping gain but in a choppy/whipsaw market I find it best to take smaller profits. QLD also turned out to be a nice buy into the close on Thursday. There was a slightly better base/enter here so my initial position was slightly larger. Again with Fridays price advance I bought additional shares throughout the day. Today I also sold all of my shares for an average gain of 4.30%. Could I have held to a few shares? Yes. Will I regret not? No. If QLD continues to advance there are several additional entry points possible. Potential Setups: Looking forward there are not many stocks that currently have high probability setups. GOOGL was discussed previously and has approached a month long base. If GOOGL can break above the highs set today with a large volume increase this could be the beginnings of a good run. O is also approaching a monthly base. This is very similar to GOOGL with the only difference being the O is a realty trust and thus may move bit slower in price increases. Overall market conditions are improving marginally compared to what they were two weeks ago. With that being said conditions can change quickly and price could revert to new lows. All we are able to do now is to create a list of potential stocks that are setting up or close to setting up. Market conditions still have a long way to go but always have to start changing somewhere.",
        "Many stocks have hit their bottom already Even if SPY goes down 30% from here there are likely many stocks out there that have already hit their bottoms.  Weve all seen the countless posts just showing how little the SP500 has dropped in relation to historical crashes. The implication is that you shouldnt be long in this market yet because SPY isnt even close to hitting bottom.  If youre an individual stock picker hopefully you already know that even if  true this thinking will have great opportunity cost. Individual companies bottom at different times.  The cascading domino effect is what is slowly bringing down the indexes. If a stock is dirt cheap relative to its future outlook you buy.  Pay zero mind to the indexes. For example If you bought Nike or Amazon right as the SP500 bottomed in Sep 2002 you would have missed out on tons of gains.  Nike bottomed in feb 2000 below $2.50 and was well over $4 when SPY bottomed. Amazon bottomed in September 2001 and was a 3 bagger by the time SPY bottomed. If you know a companys stock is way too cheap ignore spy just buy it.",
        "I thought I was a stock picking wizard until 2022 came Going into 2022 with portfolio pretty much full of growth tech / biotech hasnt been pretty so far.  Lost about half from that glorious top last year. Better than Cathie Wood though yay BTW remember 2020? Everyone loved Cathie. Genomic revolution yada yada. Now everyone hates Cathie of course. ARK will probably be around for a while but Zoom is not going to $1500 by 2026. Are you kidding me Cathie? Fire those interns aka analysts asap. Ok enough about Cathie. So after 20/21 marvelous returns around 100% combined I thought..holy s this is great I got this...going to pay off my wife medical school loan earlier a tip: dont marry anyone with medical school loan debt maybe we will get bigger house you know man can dream well now at 6% interest rates plus houses being ridiculously overpriced this is not happening regardless of how stock market is doing.  Then 2022 came... Well I shifted a good chunk of portfolio into GOOGL/AMZN from growth last year about 20% allocation but that didnt help much. Biotech in particular has been in BRUTAL bear marker ever. Btw average investor should NOT touch biotechs especially small cap ones. But if you want to gamble and lose money anyway in the end sure go ahead and invest in biotechs especially development stage ones. What I learned though during this bear market well energy or big pharma bros would say what bear market are you talking about that your conviction absolutely helps you to hold on to equities during steep corrections. If you did enough due diligence and know what you own you most likely will stick around even after gt; 50% decline. If you bought something on borrowed conviction then most likely you are shaken out by this time. Hang in there folks better times will come unless of course you bought oversized position in Teladoc or Carvana on top  Bear markets are unavoidable. We just need to be mentally prepared for those. Macro bros / FCF experts / perma bears think we are going way lower. The thing is that nobody knows. I continue DCAing at this point. I wont catch a bottom and I dont need to honestly. Also all sectors do NOT decline equally as well. If SPY corrects other 20% from here that does not necessarily mean that XBI for instance will follow. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Top 3 holdings: GOOGL NET AMZN praying for the rest. EDIT: its pretty amazing how Im getting blamed in the comments for giving people advices Are you kidding me? This is solely my investment journey for the past few years and nothing on here is financial advice just clarifying it. EDIT 2: wow plenty of responses on here are such cliche.

        "Gold vs. SPY  Is it time to exchange? Over the past five years gold has been steadily rising in price $1800 per oz. currently.

Besides all of that I was wondering if roboadvisors simply wait till a certain point to sell VOO and buy SPY or the other way around or do they simply do it in a fraction of a second constantly switching between the two so that the shortterm capital gains tax of 37.5% roughly my bracket is imposed or in other words you only receive 62.5% of my losses on a tax basis assuming I have other taxable income/gains of course?",

        "Do any of you have a set cash number for an actual retirement goal? Whats your magic cash number or stock hold where instead of reinvesting gains you would take them out as a livable wage? For instance if I get 1k shares of SPY I feel like I could live very comfortably just running the wheel. Selling weekly 10 covered calls or CSPs 4 times a month I could see someone very reasonably generating 10k a month to live on thats even after cashing out a 70% return vice getting assigned and taking a chunk out for taxes. Or is your idea of retirement just accumulating enough to live off dividends?",

An example would be that I enter the amount of shares I have in SPY and SCHD and it tells me my breakdown in sectors.

        "ELI5  What should an European maybe you too do in current EUR/USD situation Hi all I cannot bring my mind about what to do now when i see the strentgth of the USD. Lets assume the following situation: February: Eur/Usd 1.2 I bought 100k of SPY ETF in EUR in february. This where 120k USD of SPY in february. Lets assume SPY dropped 20% since then: Today: Eur/usd 1 I now have 100k USD of SPY. This translates to 100k of EUR. Although the market lost 20% people in Europe did not lose money from february until today. So the strong dollar saved our ass. HOWEVER: this means that if SPY goes back to ATH and the EUR strengthens again to the 1.2 ratio. My upside is 20% less in current enviroment than ones of a us citizen. Can somebody explain to me what one should do now? Should i AND You in the US with USD buy european ETFs with european companies and EUR as base currency? Or is it all the same? I think my brain lacks basic understanding. I mean i could sell all SPY today and would have outperformed any american citizen by 20% What am i missing :",

        "I need some help understanding JDST I made a similar post yesterday so forgive me on that note. JDST is an inverse stock of gold mining. So i assume that as gold prices go up. Gold mining will become more valuable and JDST stock will go down in price as gold goes up. Ive been reading about gold and from a site explaining golds pricing in an economy  When the economy is healthy options such as stocks real estate and bonds are viewed as more profitable investments keeping gold prices low.    The economy has been on a downturn since April. SPY is like a rock rolling downhill. So if the market isnt doing great. Why did JDST drop like 8% today?",
        "How is SPY so much higher than preCovid levels still? Really hoping someone might be able to educate me a bit here. Before COVID I feel like the economy was doing really well and outlook was great. Then there was a steep drop followed by unprecedented Fed intervention. Now were starting to feel the effects of that intervention. On top of that we have a war thats affecting oil supply and supply chains. People cant afford housing and food to the levels they could before. Yet stocks like Apple are still at a whopping 2.4 trillion market cap. Any time SPY falls a bit the dip gets bought back up. I dont understand. Really hoping someone has some insight as to how this is happening. Thanks",
        "Mays CPI data was 8.6% SPY crashes 50 points for a whole week Junes was worse at 9.1% but SPY then rebounds and goes higher within a day. I dont get it. How does this make sense? Peak inflation thats going to stay around 10% is a good thing? And record interest rates hikes on the table is bullish? Why is the market not making any sense right now..",
        "8/10/22 Tell yo friends TLDR: CPI in August is doom or boom. The CPI numbers for June were higher than expected and the market dipped.  Suddenly a 1% rate hike was on the table but Fed officials affirmed maintaining 0.75% for their next meeting July 27/28 and the market rallied. By not going for a 1% hike the Fed is calling peak inflation. The next two weeks there will be a moderate rally followed by fear selling before the next CPI release. 8/10/22 is the next CPI release.  If inflation dips the market is going ape shit and youll see articles about a possible soft landing.  If not things get really tricky.  The next Fed meeting is 9/20 to 9/21. The Fed doesnt want to drop the hammer because midterm elections are in November but if they dont the next meeting isnt until November 1st and 2nd  way too late to stop inflation and political suicide at the same time. So wheres that leave us?  8/10/22 CPI is probably the most critical financial day this year.  Either JPow beats inflation and becomes Saint Jerome or JPow drops the hammer on inflation by raising rates bends over and shows the stock market his taint revealing his jail tat that says Fuck Yo Calls in old English font.

        "SPY vs UPRO DIA vs UDOW I was wondering if a person is willing to just invest in the index for the long term and average down even in our current bear market situation. Couldnt they just buy the leveraged version instead for the long term? The losses may be magnified but so would the gains once the index recovers and make new highs 5 10 15 years later. Once an investment goal is achieved they probably shift it into SPY or DIA and live off the dividend with yields of 1.5% and 2% respectively. Any thoughts on this fellow investors?",

        "Anyone ever sell OTM covered calls on SPY every other day as an investment strategy for long term? Heres my plan. Buy 100 shares of SPY.  Sell OTM call at least $5 out that expires in 2 days.  Worst case scenario I make $600 in 2 days $100 premium plus $500 in capital appreciation but my shares are gone and I miss out on more gains if the SPY goes up a few percentage points.  At that point I can just start over again.  Best case scenario SPY goes sideways and I just collect $100  $200 every other day in premium.  Since I have the intention of just using SPY as a longterm investment 10 year time horizon how is there much of a downside? Has anyone done this for any amount of time?

        "How long it took from the 2000 and 2008 crash; just a reminder to hold on. The other day I tried to put things into perspective. Im prepared for lingering effects of the macro right now but I DCA into VTI and SPY consistently.  I looked back at SPY from the high before the crash in 2000 and it wouldve basically taken 7 years to see your position turn green not factoring in dividends. Similarly in 2008 it wouldve taken 5 years to see it break through that 150 mark or so. So you couldve been somebody who bought SPY and never see it break through 150 or so for 12 years. Thats a long time I hope it is over sooner and markets have not made sense since 2020 but Im a buckled in just in case its 23 years to get back to even on things bought today.

Did he view Apple as a holdout that had fared better than the overall market and as such was a put just an insurance policy against the fall of the stock market overall? Or did he view Apple as overpriced considering the shaky condition of the economy? Was a put against Apple more affordable than a SPY put perhaps?",

        "Luck vs. Talent: Analyst Estimates for Individual Equities amp; What it Means for StockPicking Ive been a big proponent of Upstart stock because of the proven benefits. Its AI lending program is statistically superior to those that rely on traditional FICO scores. Their focus on subprime consumer loans is but a foray into lending markets that are orders of magnitude larger such as car loans and mortgages. I was not a fan of their pandering to Wall Street by removing loans from their balance sheet but I dont think it will derail them from their longterm goals. Best of all their stock has been trading as if theyre going to zero when their financials are absolutely stellar. On TIKR Terminal which I highly recommend for longterm fundamental investors analysts tend to agree with estimates guiding for solid growth. However they also predict serious setbacks in 2025 which would put a huge dent in their progress: 2022           2023          2024           2025         2026 Revenue:          1083.23    1379.37    2107.31    1379.00   157.00    CAGR 9.3% % Change YoY    27.7%         27.3%        52.8%         34.6%     12.2% This seems very strange to me and I cant find any sort of reasoning behind it. For one were witnessing the credit cycle rollover as I type this. The macro environment couldnt be worse for them. Still they are maintaining growth and have stabilized their lending program. Additionally their AI is learning at a faster pace than ever as this cycle provides reams of data that mightve otherwise taken years to accrue. What could possibly be the driver of such a catastrophic shortfall specifically in the year 2025? I have no other idea outside the expectation for a repeat of this years downcycle with Upstart again falling prey to a collapse in debt markets. But the thing is no one can predict these thingslike not in the slightest. My larger questions therefore are what goes into guidance like this and how accurate are analysts at these ranges? My gut tells me the answers are random bullshit and not very but I honestly dont have access to the data. There are countless analysts some better than others. I dont know which ones factored into the consensus estimates for Upstart on TIKR not to mention the limitless estimates that go into stocks around the world across a multitude of platforms and at varying timeframes. Theres no way they can predict what will happen with a company in ten fifteen thirty years. But even three years out seems impossible quite frankly. Just look at the last three years during which we experienced the fastest crash in history due to a global pandemic the fastest recovery in history due to loose monetary policy that extended FAR past its expiration date and therefore the biggest inflation shock in over 40 years. Zero people could have foreseen these macroeconomic events let alone the effects they would have on individual companies. 99% of Reddit guaranteed the second Great Depression in April 2020a year in which $SPY ended up rising 18%. So my last question to everyone here is: How do you manage guidance and estimates in spite of their horrific track record? A small slice of people are far better than others when it comes to investing. I tend to believe that this has to do more with emotional control and composure than intelligence and foresight regarding macroeconomic trends. There are traders who can use technical analysis to make 300% in a year but theyll rarely beat a longterm investor that sits on their hands and lets their winners run upwards of 100X. Thats why I keep buying during times like these when people cant manage the red in their accounts and the comparisons between current totals vs ATHs. At the same time sticking with a select group of stocks requires some sort of foresight right? Or else why would you pick that stock in the first place? To go back to the original example Im gobbling shares of Upstart now because its not only fundamentally cheap but also specifically because its riding the downturn and I want to buy closer to the bottom than the top. Also theyre miles ahead of any other AI lender perhaps even decades aside from maybe Pagaya which operates in another sector anyhow. But I wouldnt deign to predict whats going to happen on a yeartoyear basis. In the end I wonder how much investing relies on luck vs. ability. The old saying time in the market beats timing the market sounds great but not to the investor who threw their lifes savings into tech stocks in November 2021. This is straight up luck as inflation had just emerged as an issue and no one truly knew it would be this perniciousleast of all the Fed. If these firsttime investors view this experience as indicative of the market as a whole they might eat their losses and never come back. Given their limited experience were they bad investors or simply unlucky? FWIW Im down 50% from the highs. Ive always believed volatility is the price you pay for returns and that the market over the long term goes up. But past performance has no bearing on future returnsor does it? Have my years of success indicated that I have a knack for picking stocks? Could Warren Buffett possibly have been lucky? How much experience is required to claim that ones success or failure is due to skill or a lack thereof? TLDR: TIKR Terminal provides analyst estimates for each company. Some estimates go out as far as 2026 or 2027. Do you think analysts can make estimates for individual companies let alone macroeconomic trends with anything resembling accuracy? And for those that can how much of their success can we attribute to talent vs. luck? What are the metrics that distinguish these features?",
        "Is Samp;P500 trading volume really lower during summer? Where to see this? I sometimes read that trading volume is lower during summer months because many institutional investors being on vacation. Lower volume means certain market moves can give false impressions as for example on bad economic news markets could still jump higher suddenly if some pension fund makes a big buy already planned in advance however unrelated to economic events that normally would drive the market. Now my question.. is it really true trading volume of the Samp;P500 is lower right now in July so during summer and where can you clearly see those daily volumes and the difference with normal periods on a chart? If I look on Yahoo Finance on the chart for VOO or SPY since beginning of the year at the bottom you can see bars showing daily volume however when i hover over thoses bars with my mouse I dont really see that current volumes in July are lower than other months. Anybody can show where this can be seen much clearer unless the Yahoo Finance chart also shows this and im just misreading it. Thanks for all the help.",

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 1st 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 1st 2022.  Stocks head into August with a tailwind as investors await jobs data and a slew of earnings  Source  gt; From Caterpillar to Amgen dozens of large companies report earnings in the coming week but it may be big economic data such as Fridays jobs report that takes over as a major market catalyst.  gt; Monthly employment reports are always important but the next few may be even more so. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made it clear at his press briefing Wednesday that the Feds September rate decision will depend on economic data.  gt; Stocks rallied in the past week helped by betterthanexpected earnings reports and a view that the Federal Reserve may not be as aggressive as it forecast when it comes to interest rate hikes.  gt; The major stock market indexes ended July with their best monthly performance of the year and the Samp;P 500 and Dow scored their best months since November 2020. The Nasdaqs 12.3% gain was its best monthly performance since April 2020.  gt; The Samp;P was up 4.3% for the week and 9.1% for the month of July. It is still down 13.3% for the year. The Nasdaq was up 4.7% for the week. The Dow was up nearly 3% for the week and 6.7% for the month.  gt; Earnings stink but theyre not as bad as they could have been said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA. The Fed raised rates the most aggressively since 1981 but thats good because the economy is slowing down and thats good because the Fed might start tapering its tone.  gt; Some of the biggest names in tech delivered earnings beats in the past week and their stocks were higher such as Apple Microsoft and Amazon. There have also been some big misses and negative forecasts like from Meta Platforms and Intel. Intel was down 8.6% Friday after its earnings miss and lowered forecast.  gt; Thus far the market has been able to digest it said Art Hogan chief investment strategist at National Securities. A lot of this is better than feared. If that process continues its likely to help the market grind higher. The market seems to be sitting on this notion that we had priced in Armageddon and thus far that has not been thrust upon us.  gt; Hogan said many investors were caught underinvested or even short stocks during the July rally. That helps throw some gasoline on the fire he said.  gt; In the week ahead there are 148 Samp;P 500 companies reporting earnings. Reports come from a diverse group of companies such as healthcare names Eli Lilly Gilead Sciences and Amgen. There will also be reports from travelrelated companies such as Uber and Booking Holdings.  gt; Stocks enter August riding the optimism of July but since 1995 the Samp;P 500 has declined by an average 0.5% in the month according to CFRA. August has also been the third most volatile month and only three major Samp;P sectors over that time had averaged gains for the month: real estate technology and utilities.  gt; Techs outperformance during the month does help the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 increased an average 0.9% in August going back to 1995 according to CFRA.  gt; Its a month that could go either way because it has among the highest single monthly advances while at the same time among the deepest single monthly decline said Stovall. For instance the Samp;P 500 gained 11.6% in August 1992 and fell 14.6% in August 1998.  gt; Stovall said the Samp;P 500 could be tested early in the week. The Samp;P ended the week at 4130. Around 4150 is a very important resistance level he said.  gt;  Recession? gt; Investors have been worried about the prospect that the Federal Reserves tightening could push the economy into a recession.  gt; However Thursdays report that secondquarter gross domestic product declined by 0.9% was taken in stride in part because the market has been betting the Fed will have to slow down its hiking. The economy has now contracted two quarters in a row and it is considered to be in what some economists say is a technical recession. But most say it is not yet a real recession because of labor market strength and other factors.  gt; The markets are focused on the potential for a bigger slowdown  particularly the bond market. In the past week the closely watched 10year yield fell to 2.64% from 2.75% the week earlier. Yields fall when prices rise and the 10year note was lifted by buyers who were concerned about economic weakness.  gt; The 10years yield is important since mortgage rates and other business and consumer loans are influenced by it.  gt; The top tier U.S. data is important for this recession narrative. One thing that kicked off recession talk was the ISM services data so ISM is going to be important said NatWests John Briggs. Services ISM slowed less than expected in June but a measure of employment within the report fell to a twoyear low.  gt; The Institute of Supply Managements manufacturing survey is released on Monday and the ISM services report is due out Wednesday.  gt; Traders have been betting in the futures market that the Fed will have to start cutting rates next year but the Feds forecast does not show that. The Fed raised its target fed funds rate by 0.75% of a percentage point Wednesday the second hike in a row of that size. The next rate hike expected in September could be smaller.  gt; Briggs said the markets recession worries may be overdone.  gt; The jobs report has to be not bad. Powell called the labor market extremely tight so I just think the market went a little bit overboard here said Briggs Now it just needs to be not terrible.  gt; The July employment report Friday morning is expected to show the economy added 250000 jobs according to Dow Jones. That is down from 372000 jobs added in June.  gt; If the jobs report is bad to me its not more good news. ... If the jobs report is bad its more information were just begging this recession rather than finishing this recession said David Bianco chief investment officer Americas at DWS.  gt; Bianco said he expects the economy is heading for a recession but because of inflation not the Feds rate hikes.  gt; The big issue for the stock market is tech and how its doing since it dominates the market Bianco said.  gt; Tech stocks were slammed by rising interest rates as the 10year yield climbed earlier in the year. Investors pay up for growth and tech stocks because of the promise of future earnings.  gt; People say if the 10year is done going up how bad are the technology earnings going to be? said Bianco. I caution with the idea that tech will be damaged by recession and a strong dollar and this would be from spending on the consumer side and the business side of technology. Its not that valuations are cheap. ... This may be a shallow recession but Im not convinced its going to be a short one.  gt; Bianco said he likes utilities health care and aerospace and defense. For those that want to take a cyclical risk I like the big banks he said. He said the banks do not have the balance sheet issues they had in the financial crisis.  gt; The overnight rate is going to be the driver of their net interest margins especially at the big banks he said. Banks are in a better position than they normally are in a recession.

The March meeting was the first rate hike of the Feds current tightening cycle and every meeting since then has seen a hike of at least 50 basis points. Each time the Samp;P surged on the day of the hike. gt; The recent equity market strength on Fed Days is a new trend. Market performance on Fed Days during Powells first few years at the helm was notoriously weak. Below we show the Samp;P 500s average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair since 1994 when policy changes first started being announced on the same day as the meeting. For Chair Powell we show the Samp;Ps average performance on Fed Days during his tenure only through July 2021. At the time a year ago Powell Fed Days were by far the worst of any Fed chair and the market typically plunged into the close after the 2 PM ET announcement. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; What a difference a year makes. Below we show the Samp;Ps average intraday performance on Fed Days by Fed chair updated through the most recent FOMC meeting this week. Whereas Powell Fed Days were by far the worst for the market at this time last year theyre now the second best behind only Bernanke Fed Days. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; To highlight the improvement in the market response to Fed Chair Powell another way below we show the fullday percentage change of the Samp;P 500 on Fed Days during Powells tenure as well as how the cumulative averages have evolved for both the fullday change and performance from 2:30 PM ET through the close encapsulating the market response to the presser or the chair more directly. gt; As you can see the Samp;P was extremely weak on Powell Fed Days early on during his tenure but over the last year the market has reacted extremely positively. Seven of the last eight Powell Fed Days have seen positive moves for the Samp;P with the last four all seeing gains of more than 1%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Typical August Trading: Usually a Tepid Month gt; Money flows from harvesting once made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best DJIA month from 1901 to 1951. However since then and even more recently over the last 21years August has been a disappointing month. The first eight or nine trading days have historically been weak with the major indexes shedding around 0.4% to 1.2%. This weakness is then followed by a brief midmonth rally that typically lasts until the 13th trading day. From there until late month the indexes have tended to wander sideways to lower before springing back to life ahead of months end. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Augusts First Trading Day Weakest of All gt; On page 90 of the Stock Traders Almanac 2022 it is shown that the first trading days of each month combined have produced an outsized share of the markets overall gains. However the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2022 Almanac. In the upcoming 2023 edition of the Almanac Augusts first trading day is still the worst. In the past 24 years DJIA has risen just 36.4% up 8 down 16 of the time on the first trading day of August. Several sizable gains in those up years have mitigated the average first day percent change but the median performance is a more sizable loss. Over the past 11 years DJIA and Samp;P 500 have both declined 8 times. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Worst Year for Sentiment On Record gt; Bullish sentiment measured by the weekly AAII survey has been a series of back and forth moves over the past several weeks. After reaching the highest level in over a month last week bullish sentiment fell back down to 27.7%. Even with that decline bullish sentiment has now managed to hold above 25% for at least three weeks in a row for the first time since the start of the year. We also must note that the AAII survey collects data from Thursday at 12:01 AM through Wednesday 11:59 PM meaning any boost to sentiment from yesterdays FOMC postmeeting rally will not necessarily be fully captured in this report. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Whereas bullish sentiment has had its fair share of back and forth moves bearish sentiment has more consistently fallen with this week being the third sequential decline in a row. Now at 40% bearish sentiment is at the lowest level since the first week of June. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Given the drop in bulls was slightly smaller than that of bears this week the bullbear spread continued to move in a less negative direction. However in spite of any improvement this week was the 17th negative reading in a row as that streak remains the third longest on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Not only have bears outnumbered bulls for 17 straight weeks but there has actually only been one week this year the final week of March in which that was not the case. As a result this year is on pace to have averaged the lowest levels of bullish sentiment and the highest levels of bearish sentiment of any year in the surveys history. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; With both bulls and bears lower in the most recent survey neutral sentiment picked up the difference rising to 32.2%. That is the most elevated reading since April and back into the middle of the postpandemic range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Big Revision in Claims gt; Initial jobless claims continue to disappoint. Although this weeks release technically fell down to 256K it was from a 10K upwardly revised number of 261K last week. Both this week and lasts readings are the highest since the fall and would also mark the highest readings since the fall of 2017 outside of the historically elevated readings of the pandemic. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The pandemic was a volatile time period for jobless claims data as readings rose into the millions. As such revisions over the past couple of years have gotten historically large in turn albeit less so over the past year. Although it may not sound like much last weeks 10K revision was actually sizable. It was the largest revision since the week of July 4th last year and prior to the pandemic the week before Christmas in 2012 was the last time there was a doubledigit revision. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In his post meeting presser Fed Chair Powell mentioned how the rise in initial jobless claims may be seasonal in nature. While we will provide some more in depth analysis to these comments in regards to the data in tonights Closer as we have noted in the past jobless claims have been roughly following standard historical seasonal patterns this year. July typically sees a temporary seasonal spike higher but as we noted last week that seasonal peak appears to have been put in place a bit later than usual which is rare but not exactly an unprecedented occurrence. While claims will likely get some seasonal tailwinds in the coming weeks including this week of the year as claims have fallen around 90% of the time historically the actual level of claims for the current week of the year is now well above comparable weeks for the few years prior to the pandemic. In other words before or after seasonal adjustment claims have come off their strongest levels and revisions have not exactly made things any better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As for continuing claims the latest week saw a 25K decline to 1.359 million. While that does mark some deterioration from the strongest levels unlike initial claims continuing claims are still well below levels from prior to the pandemic indicating a still very healthy labor market the likes of which has not been seen in decades as the insured unemployment rate continuing claims as a percentage of the number of those covered by state insurance programs continues to hover near 1%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Most Countries Remain Below PreCOVID Highs gt; As we do the last Wednesday of each month today we published our latest update of the Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the major economic data and financial markets of 22 major global economies. Taking a look at the US ETFs tracking these same countries shows a broad move higher in equities around the globe during the month of July. The US has led the way higher as the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY has rallied just over 5%. India INDA Sweden EWD and Singapore EWS have seen the next strongest moves with each one rallying 4% or more. That has brought US equities India and Singapore back above their 50DMAs as well. gt; Given those moves are in the context of much larger pullbacks year to date most country ETFs also currently remain below their preCOVID highs the 52week high as of the Samp;P 500 peak on 2/19/20. In fact SPY INDA Taiwan EWT and Canada EWC are the only countries meaningfully above prior highs. Switzerland EWL is also technically a part of that list but the one basis point difference is not much of a margin. At the moment Brazil is down the most significantly from its preCOVID high as it is still down 43%. However unlike many other countries the yeartodate decline has been very modest at only 1.76%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Taking a look at the charts of the four countries that are handily above their preCOVID highs the trends of the past year are not exactly positive. Each one currently sits in a multimonth downtrend and only India and the US have managed to break above their 50DMAs. Even if those moving averages have been taken out further progress by bulls would be required to eliminate those downtrends. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies tickers reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "SPY or QQQ in this environment? Curious as to what you would invest in today. I would like to continue building a portfolio of SPY but considering Im 20 I was thinking about buying a decent amount of QQQ first then buying SPY after I have a decent amount of QQQ.  My biggest worry is that I could still lose decent amounts of money. If I invested in QQQ in 2000 my investment in SPY would be worth more from DOT.com bubble. Does anyone feel QQQ is overvalued for P/E ratios?  Edit: grammar",
        "rebalancing my portfolio manually to follow the Samp;P500 Im an europoor with money in USDs. Im thinking now is a good time to start DCAing into SPY but I cant buy US ETFs since Im from the EU. Since it rebalances every quarter would it make sense to just rebalance my portfolio by hand by mirroring the spy ?",
        "Do you believe this rally is another headfake? Maybe short the SPY at 417? So the question is have we already hit bottom for 2022? If youre buying individual stocks or pouring money into ETFs you probably think weve already hit bottom. However others believe this is just a temporarily rally with much more pain headed our way. Including new 52 week lows for just about every major tech company. If youre in the 2nd camp youre probably twiddling your thumbs wondering what you should do. Maybe youve got a nice chunk of cash sitting on the sidelines waiting for the inevitable failure of this rally. Im in this conundrum. Basically waiting. I dont think weve seen the bottom of 2022. I think more pain is coming. Ive looked closely at the SPY and it seems like there might be some resistance at 416/417. One strategy could be to jump in something like SH at around 416.50 or so on the SPY.  If the SPY hits 419 you lost sell out and maybe try again at 424/425 another possible resistance zone. Also if anybody else is considering shorting the SPY at a certain point what do you use to short it? Whenever Ive temporarily shorted the SPY I used SH. Its the ProShares Short Samp;P 500",
        "Why Are All of The Suggestions Here for VXUS and not SPGM? I see nearly universal support here for VXUS as an ETF to buy to have exposure to global markets. Looking at VXUS performance it seems like a pretty poor ETF to be investing in. Sure you get exposure to the global markets but it seems like you probably wont make any meaningful gains from that exposure. To make matters worse it doesnt pay out a dividend so you are solely relying on the growth. SPGM on the other hand has pretty solid performance. SPGM doesnt give you as much exposure to global markets as it seems to have a decent amount of US based companiesbut that may not be a horrible thing while still getting exposure to the global markets. It is like the US allocation in SPGM is a hedge against their global holdings. Plus it does pay a dividend. I never see SPGM suggested here and only VXUS. Why not? SPGM is pretty much SPY with the added bonus of having exposure to global markets.",
        "Are margin loans a better means of attaining leverage than LEAPS? I am using the Lifecycle Investing strategy proposed by Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres in their book of the same name which states that one should use 2:1 leverage for the first few years of their career as a long term investment strategy. The way they suggest doing this is by buying index funds like SPY with margin loans and LEAPS among other means. I am currently trying to determine which of the first two is the better option by calculating which of those two would require the lowest stock price change to break even. Lets say I had $10000 and I put it in SPY with no leverage. Since SPY has a 30day yield of 1.42 we may assume that the dividend returns would be 1.42% over then next year so the stock price could fall by 1001001/1.0142=1.4% 1.4% change and you would still break even because of the dividend. Since I use rbinhood pls dont hate if I want to use 2:1 leverage through margin loans I can borrow $10000 to buy SPY on top of the $10000 I own with my money. The margin interest rate is 5% right now which is calculated by adding 2.5% to the target federal funds rate which will also go up to decrease inflation. Assuming it stays the same however the price change for SPY to reach breakeven with margin loans would be 52x1.42/2=1.08%. I pretty much took the interest rate subtracted from it the 30day yield times 2 because now we get twice as many dividends because we have twice as many shares and then divided that result by 2 because we also get double the gains for the same change in price. Furthermore we can also attain 2:1 leverage by buying a $205 9/23 SPY Call. SPY is currently priced at $413 and that calls ask price is $214 meaning that SPYs breakeven price change in this case would be 205214/4131100=1.45%. Since you miss out on dividends with calls we dont need to consider them here. According to my methodology and please correct  me if it is wrong margin loans appear to be the superior option especially for someone like me who is young and has a smaller account. The margin interest rate would need to go up by another .74% for the margin loan approach to have the same breakeven point as the LEAP approach. You might say thats likely to happen given more future rate hikes by the federal reserve. But even then each one of those calls costs $21400 and thus this approach requires at least that much money if not way more to successfully implement. Finally as prices fluctuate your leverage will too. If I used the margin loan approach mentioned earlier and SPY fell by 25% I would end up with $15000 worth of SPY shares. Since I have $10000 in loans of that $15000 only $5000 would be mine and therefore I would have 3:1 leverage. I would thus need to rebalance by selling stock to pay off my loans as the price goes down and take out loans to buy more stock as the price goes up to retain 2:1 leverage. The LEAP approach also requires rebalancing but since each LEAP is $20K you would actually need a lot more money than that to rebalance. Are there any factors that I have overlooked or is the margin approach simply better?",
        "Have 4.5K in SPY should I sell and buy VOO? Hello Im pretty new to investing recently I learned that VOO has a cheaper expense ratio not quite sure what that even means than SPY Ive been holding SPY for 2 years now and Im down $300 should I move my investments into VOO? Or is it too late and should just invest future stocks into VOO? Thanks.",
        "Should you diversify your Samp;P 500 indexes? Recently left my company and am investing my now IRA money personally. Am planning to keep the vast majority in Samp;P 500 index funds. Is there any reason to diversity between them? I.E. is it ok to have 100% in VTI or would you do 25% VTI 25% SPY 25% VOO etc? Not sure theres any reason to but dont want to mess this up",
        "Backtesting historically frozen SP500 components Ive been searching around but most data is patchy and incomplete so before I reinvent my wheels Id like to check if the data Im looking for is already somewhere or at least there are several sources I can use to lighten my workload: My objective is to backtest an investment in SPY that was lumpsummed once. For example if I invested $10K in SPY on 1st May 1988 AND this is a big AND the SPY components stay the same as of 1stMay1988 until today that means if a ticker was removed after the date we continue to backtest its performance and we ignore tickers added after that date. I believe I need the following data: 1. List of SP500 components on any one date 2. Weight of these 500 tickers on that date With these data I can do individual backtest then weight them accordingly. Why am I doing this? Admittedly this has no financial value because it doesnt replicate real life scenario. However I strongly believe in cycle and balance which means what goes up must come down etc etc and SPY is the only one that is always going up perhaps it is due its components and weights keep changing so I just want to scratch this itch.",
        "Charting on ES/NQ amp; Trading SPY/QQQ? Hi Everyone Apologies in advance for the noob question. Tried searching but I havent seen a direct answer for this.

Appreciate any links to anything related to this.",
        "Psychology of Averaging Up Im currently reviewing my 2022 portfolio because 12th August is the first green day for me since the war broke. In the past 6 month my strategy has been buy more deeper dips basically my purchase doubled with every 510% drop e.g. 10 shares 20 shares 10% 50 shares 20% 100 shares 30% etc. Fortunately the market started to turn around before I run out of bullets. However what I didnt do and dont like to do or couldnt do is to average up I also have slightly less problem paying more than the lowest price I paid before. For example YTD the lowest SPY I got was $363 that was my last purchase of SPY even though my average is $392. There were plenty of opportunities in $370s and $380s range that I saw but consciously ignored to continue to buy and average down. As soon as SPY crossed $392 I stopped watching it because I couldnt bring myself to average up. Im sure you see a lot of flaws in my methods and would probably advise time in the market..... or just DCA and chill. Yes I understand these methods and there are stats to back them up but the emotional/psychological side of me is actively resisting them. Now the weekend is here can you guys recommend books chapters or articles that specifically address these behaviours? Something more layman like instead of pointing out smoking causes lung cancer based on many researches and stats these books deploy/introduce other social/emotional/psychological influences to change the behaviour? Thanks",
        "Buy and hold SPY vs run the wheel Ive asked in the past how much you could expect to make selling puts or covered calls on SPY and all the answers seemed to be above the average yearly return of the samp;p.

        "What does everyone think of this historical $SPY chart on the log scale? Its very interested and I have a link here for the interactive chart if your interested.  What do you all think? Are we really going to continue this bull market from here or are we due for a historical correction? amp;x200B; My thoughts: I think from looking at this chart that it shows the stock market is historically over valued and over stretched. You can see during the dot come bubble it was really high like it is now but then it somehow crashed.  I would say without a doubt we are currently in another huge financial bubble from this chart. Things are definitely not normal right now. amp;x200B;  I was hoping you could give me your thoughts.",
        "Are you buying at these levels? Hello all Cheers to the bull on recent market rally. I have been on sidelines since DecJan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping. Now everything is overvalued again. Forward Samp;P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900. I am not an expert but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However it does not seem we will revisit June bottom and that is ok but I am hoping for a pullback in Samp;P to below 4000. My current plan is to start small DCAing next week and wait until September most volatile month and before next fed meeting and start buying at lump sums if Samp;P 500 goes below 4000. amp;x200B; But are you buying not scalping at these levels? and if so why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing? amp;x200B; Disclaimer: I am long index funds and GOOGL. I also hold couple QQQ puts for hedging which got burned.",
        "Can someone ELIF what it means as far as there are no taxes if you withdraw contributions? Im a 33 year old long term investor with a Roth IRA and a taxable account. I dont plan on withdrawing anytime soon just curious how it works.  With a a taxable account arent there no taxes if you withdraw contributions yet there are taxes on gains?  How exactly does it work? Say someone has contributed $10000 per year for 5 years all into SPY for simplicitys sake. Thats a total of $50000 they put in. Current balance with the gains doesnt necessarily matter as long as its above $30000 for this example. Say they want to withdraw $30000.  Is it possible to do so and pay no taxes? Why or why not? Even if the price of the shares went up $30000 is obviously less than the $50000 put in",
        "Reminder to take gains on the way up Weve seen a huge rally in stocks over the past 3 weeks. QQQ is up from its June low of 271 to 333 currently. SPY pushed from June low of 365 to 429 currently. Many of the high flying stocks that make up these indexes are up over 50% in that same time period. Even ARKK has rallied from 36 to 52 in that same timeframe. amp;x200B; Many other high volatility stocks that were super hot a year ago are slowly recovering. This is a reminder to not get overly excited and start dumping allin life savings back into the market because of a potential bull market fomo. Dont make the same mistakes of the past. Dont forget to assess your risk profile and take gains on the way up. Theres no harm in selling some shares of a stock thats run up 50% in the 2 weeks. You beat the hell out of the market on the long term with that move. For example I love ENPH. I plan to hold it long term. But in the past 6 months its gone up from $140 to $300. Do I believe that ENPH is the future? Absolutely. But at a P/S of 23 and P/E of 200 its not a bad idea of selling a small portion based on your risk appetite to secure the gains and maybe move it into something more stable while you wait for more information to surface about the market and economy. Maybe I miss out 10% more gains. But if Im patient I can move it into a sector that has more value and higher chance to run up than cleanenergy. Maybe a stock in a sector that has the chance to run up 100% in 5 months like ENPH did. amp;x200B; Again all this is based on your risk profile. No one has a crystal ball but the only way to get rich on stocks is to actually sell at some point. Maybe selling small amounts of individual shares of fast moving recovering stocks that had great quarters ie. NET ENPH CRWD AMD will help free up some capital to buy more of them on the next downturn. No one can time tops of bottoms but just remember that taking gains is always a legitimate strategy. Even if the gains are small amounts. Take that money and treat yourself to something nice. Money isnt worth anything if you dont spend it on making your life easier or more enjoyable. amp;x200B; Last thing: the hardest thing to train yourself to do in the stock market is to sell into green and buy into red. Human psychology forces the opposite behaviour so you have to actively retrain your mind.",
        "Do ETFs ever dissolve? How does that impact holders? When I was younger I played around with individual stocks made some big wins and a lot large losses. It basically ended up as a wash. As a result in recent years and as Ive started to make more money Im primarily in VGT NASDAQ tracking SPLG/SPY Samp;P500 tracking and DIA Dow Jones tracking. My weighting is roughly as follows: 60% tech 20% Samp;P500 10% Dow Jones 10% other ETFs / a couple small holdings My question is what is the risk of well known ETFs liquidating? For example I noticed SPY has been around since the mid 90s whereas SPLG has only been around since the mid 2000s. The underlying holdings are basically the same. Younger ETFs shouldnt be a cause for concern right? Maybe its a dumb question but I just got to thinking about the risk of liquidation. Im perfectly happy holding through the ups and downs though.

        "Setting and Forgetting SPY NDAQ Bank Stocks Ive been looking at YOY returns over the past 5 years for stocks the SNP500 how different is it to the SPY ETF? is up 72% over the past 5 years NDAQ is up 147% with an additional dividend of 0.43% annually while bank stocks TD RY JPM have more modest growth of only about 2030% but have dividends around 34% annually with the largest return Ive found being TD at a growth of 34% and dividends of 4.09% annually. My parents are big fans of bank stocks precisely because of their large dividends but doing the math at best youd get say a 34x1.045 = 40 percent return on investment over five years. This just seems strictly worse than keeping everything in one of the two other stocks I mentioned. Now granted bank stocks seem more stable and they have comparable growth over all time is this a worthwhile metric? but if I decide to invest over the long term 10 years I dont see bank stocks even with high dividends beating the large strict value increase of the SPY or NDAQ.

Again though none of those other years have seen as sharp of a decline as 2022 and the Samp;P 500s drop in the same time also ranks as one of the worst. 2022 is the only year that the high yield bond index has fallen simultaneously with stocks however as we noted earlier it does not have as long of a history as those other categories. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Democrats Expected to Keep Senate Control gt; President Joe Biden currently has the worst premidterm approval rating since President Truman in 1950. A multitude of factors including inflation the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan weakening economic data age and a lack of definitive action on campaign promises have all contributed to the Presidents unpopularity. Although Americans are generally dissatisfied with the President betting markets still project a nearly twothirds chance that Democrats retain control of the Senate chart below from electionbettingodds.com. The only two previous Presidents that saw approval ratings lower than Bidens heading into midterms since the start of WWII Roosevelt in 1942 third term and Truman first term in 1946 ended up in the midterms losing twelve and five senate seats respectively. In fact only five Presidents have seen their partys position in the Senate improve or remain flat since the start of WWII in a midterm election cycle. In these five cycles the sitting President averaged an approval rating of 57.2% which is 19.2 percentage points higher than that of Biden. gt; Although only 20% of Presidential terms since the start of WWII have seen their party gain Senate seats during midterms subsequent sessions of congress following these election cycles passed some significant legislation. The 88th Congress under the Kennedy/Johnson administration passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race sex religion ethnicity or national origin. In addition that session of congress banned the discrimination of pay in regards to sex and the 24th amendment was passed which banned states from making the right to vote in federal elections conditional. The 92nd Congress under Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard and established Title IX. The 116th Congress under Trump passed the CARES act which helped the country recover from the pandemic and funded vaccination initiatives. gt; Regarding equity market returns in the five midterms where the sitting Presidents party gained Senate seats in a midterm election year the Samp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 3.1% between the election date and yearend posting gains three out of five times.

In terms of economic data we also included a look at the y/y change in CPI and the Unemployment Rate through September and then finally Gallups Presidential Approval Rating. Although one might assume that a strong stock market boosts the Presidents party in the Senate for the midterms the equity market was down on a YTD basis heading into midterms in three of the five years highlighted above. However the average y/y change in CPI was just 2.7% and only above 5% once. For the sake of comparison y/y headline CPI as of the end of July currently stands at 8.5%. In terms of approval ratings every other President who saw a gain in Senate seats in a midterm election year had the approval of a majority of Americans whereas nearly twothirds of Americans currently disapprove of the President. Given this backdrop the possibility of Democrats keeping their effective majority in the Senate would seem unlikely but with less than three months until Election Day the betting markets say otherwise. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Dividend Breakout Despite Declines gt; In last Thursdays Chart of the Day we highlighted how important dividends are for longterm investment performance. While dividends do help to boost investment returns over the long term in the short term there is often an ebb and flow of dividendfocused ETFs under and outperforming in terms of price moves. For example up until June the Samp;P 500s highest yielders measured by the SPDR Samp;P 500 High Dividend Yield ETF SPYD had mostly been trading in the green whereas the Samp;P 500 SPY was deep in the red. gt; With equities broadly taking a turn lower over the past week SPYD has held up relatively well when compared to the Samp;P 500 SPY. Even though SPYD has not avoided declines as we also showed in our decile analysis the highest dividend payers have only slightly better performance than nondividend payers the relative strength line of SPYD versus SPY has broken out of the past couple of months downtrend. That being said it has not been a sharp move higher like what was observed in the first half of the year particularly in the second quarter. In other words the highest yielders are back to outperforming the broader market but not to the same extent as earlier in the year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Two Month Rally Rotation gt; Using the Russell 3000 as a benchmark US equities peaked exactly a week ago and have traded lower in all but one session since. In all the Russell 3000 has fallen 4.33% in that time on weak breadth albeit certain stocks have been hit far harder than others. Breaking the index down into deciles ranked by a variety of factors performance has generally been the reverse of what we highlighted earlier this month in regards to the rally off of the June 16th low. gt; Over the past week stocks with higher multiples and smaller market caps have fallen the most. Those are also the ones that had become the most elevated above their moving averages after outperforming during the twomonth rally from midJune to midAugust. Conversely those stocks with more attractive valuations have tended to perform better although here too there have been low singledigit percentage declines across deciles. One other interesting point worth noting is how the highest dividend payers have been hit just as hard as other deciles for that category which is a big difference when compared to the spring when the highest dividend payers were the only pocket of positive performance. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  One Big Clue The Lows For The Year Could Be In gt; Are we having fun yet? The rollercoaster ride of 2022 continues as the furious rally off the June 16 lows has taken a breather with the Samp;P 500 Index finding resistance right at its 200day moving average a logical place for a break after a big bounce. Worries over a hawkish turn from the Fed at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week housing suggesting the economy is falling quicker than expected the war in Eastern Europe and stubborn inflation have all been listed as reasons for the recent weakness. But after a 17.4% rally off the lows maybe it was just time for a break. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; We arent surprised stocks have to take a breather after the bounce since midJune but we continue to think that stocks have likely made their low for the year and higher prices before yearend are quite possible. In fact we discussed two reasons we feel this way in Two Reasons the Bulls Should Be Smiling. gt; Will it be easy? Probably not It never is. One of the bigger nearterm worries is simply the calendar. Historically August and September are two of the weakest months of the year. Buckle up as we could see some usual seasonal volatility once again but the good news is later in the year stocks tend to do well something we anticipate to play out again. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Now for some good news The Samp;P 500 made up more than half of the bear market losses something that indeed should have bulls smiling. As we show below since 1950 stocks have never gone on to make new lows after this happened. Now this doesnt mean they will go straight up from here but the past 15 bear markets never moved back to new lows once this feat took place. Even more incredible is the Samp;P 500 was never lower a year later either up 19.3% on average. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; So there you have it yet another clue that June 16 was likely the lows and stocks potentially could be a good deal higher this time next year. The Carson Investment Research team continues to overweight stocks here anticipating continued strength.  gt;  Sentiment Slide gt; With the Samp;P 500 pivoting lower in the past week sentiment has reflected the move as the AAII sentiment survey showed bullish sentiment drop from 33.3% last week down to 27.7%. That marked the first time bullish sentiment fell in three weeks and it was the largest singleweek decline since an eleven percentage point drop the week of June 9th. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Bearish sentiment picked up the bulk of that decline as the reading topped 40% for the first time since the last week of July. At 42.4% it is at the highest level since July 14th. Although that marks a shift toward more pessimistic sentiment reversing a trend of improvement from the past few weeks the current reading on bearish sentiment is well below the highs from throughout the spring and early summer. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Nonetheless after coming within only a few points of a positive reading in the past month the bullbear spread took a sharp turn lower as a result of this weeks results. The spread fell to 14.7 which is the lowest reading since July 14th. That was also the first doubledigit weekoverweek drop in the reading since June. Additionally with a move deeper into negative territory the spread is a week away from becoming tied for the secondlongest streak of negative readings on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "How can I become more passionate about investing? My friends and family think Im doing very well financially. I have a strong amount of savings a good job thats pay well and a good amount of stock from the company I work for Ive had a few people tell me i should look more into investing and have my money work for me rather than solely focusing on working for moneytime for money I definitely agree with them but for the life of me cannot find the passion for investing like I do for my other interestslike fantasy football lol This leads me for example reading about an article about SPY and putting a few grand in and not doing anything after for weeks I know for myself I need passion to do something consistently/successfully Has anyone been in the same shoes? Are there different mental exercises I can try ?",
        "Head and Shoulders SPY and QQQ Surprised I havent seen any posts about the head and shoulders on both SPY and QQQ.  The neckline was broken last Friday and if we get a downside equal to the upside from the neckline then SPY should hit a minimum low of 392 and 293 for QQQ. Even if you didnt believe this was a bear market rally or in technical analysis a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline break is a rarity lots of people spot and bet on potentials but here we have the real thing even if on a short time frame. Personally I always thought this was a bear market rally taken to extreme levels of hopium and Im not sure the bottom is in.  But at least with the hamp;s Im pretty confident we have some more short term downside in the next few days.  And then of course after Labor Day we may get our annual September pull back on top of all this.",
        "I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022 ZACKS TLDR  They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market  Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022 but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable though many are baked into Fidelitys platform for free.  Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks especially the VGM and Zacks Rank 1 screener. But to do it right you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing whats new. Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. Its quite overwhelming actually but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services dont outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a fulltime job to buy and manage them. For most of the screeners the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped. I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down 70%. If you want the names DM me.   I did OK using the value growth and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added which they dont tell you. If you get them too late the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly. A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM health clinics DAC container shipping BERY financial and MT steel. My target was 100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost 15% on that pick though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. Its since back to slightly above the purchase price. Zacks Top 10 Stocks of 2021  their premium offering and associated returns. I did not buy all of these  only SPSC and PWR. But I did track them all in a watchlist.  Percent Winner Rate: 90%  Avg return: 48%  SPY Return: 30% AIMC transmissions 2021    Return: 6%    Return To date:  23% SPSC supply chain mgmt solutions    2021 Return: 31%    Return to Date: 15% APTV vehicle parts    2021 Return: 28%    Return to Date: 15% PWR energy generation consulting services    2021 Return: 64%    Return to Date: 107% IAA online vehicle sales    2021 Return: 46%    Return to Date: 41% WSC storage units    2021 Return: 72%    Return to Date: 84% Macys clothing retailer    2021 Return: 144%    Return to Date: 76% GDDY domain registration    2021 Return: 3%    Return to Date: 0% ZBRA tech sensors    2021 Return: 54%    Return to Date: 7% ULTA beauty stores    2021 Return: 46%    Return to Date: 38% For 2022s top 10 stocks the advice has not been quite so good but the year isnt over yet. I didnt buy any this year because I was short on the market but I have been tracking the performance to see if they can match what they did last year. So far not so good.  Percent Up Since Rec: 20%  Avg Return of Rec: 8.8%  SPY Return: 10.3% as of time I drafted amp;x200B; 2. LEVELFIELDS TLDR:  Eventdriven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website  There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to so its best to choose one of their lower volume higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload  Its good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates  For the biggest companies AAPL TSLA etc my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap its very helpful.  Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon Winning Percent: 79% Avg Return/Trade: 23% Ive been using an eventdriven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. Its good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events which is cool especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves layoffs shorts FDA approvals leadership changes Amazon new product launches and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there Ive seen it focuses on real news which I like as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind. For the big companies everyone watches they dont beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies youve never heard of or have forgotten about it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise. Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what Im choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy which is nice. The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50% with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I dont like to buy commodities and microcaps generally as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the companys control so I filter those out. Lately Ive been trading on their layoffs scenario which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. Ive noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade. Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out. Im noting hold times since its not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks. 10.21.21  Qualcomm. Return: stock rose 50% in 1 month. Traded options for 300% gain.   11.11.21  Northern Gas NOG. Return: 45%. I held for 5 months.   12.9.21  CVS. return: 60% in 1 month options   11.18.21  BLDR.

It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin. 12.6.21 Silicon Motion SIMO. 25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e. 12.9.21 Labcorp LH: 8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down 10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing 12.15.21  Broadcom AVGO.

A short wouldve worked too. 5.24.22  Digital Ocean DOCN: Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but Im selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. Its like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses. 6.15.22  Space company. 50% in two days 6.24.22  Digital Turbine APPS. 31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally. 6.28.22  Alibaba BABA. 30% on options in 3 weeks. Cant seem to get a break on BABA. 7.14.22  Pinterest PINS. 30% on hedge fund moves 7.27.22  Mining company. return: 10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up. 7.28.22  4% and holding.

It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits. amp;x200B; 3. THE FOOL I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But when I had enough money in the account I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching. TLDR:  They pick good overvalued growth stocks but they dont try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait  I wouldve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead  They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions  They make a lot of recommendations. Its time consuming to keep up.  Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5000/yr and they upsell a lot They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them including their stock advisor IPO one and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again. For the cloud services recommendations I found they generally picked out solid growth companies DOCN DOCU ESTCetc but too late after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved. 12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then Intel INTC: 29% JFrog FROG: 17% Procore PCOR: 18% 12/14/21 Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then Sell Cloudflare NET.

The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next days opening price. StockAdvisor 2.3.22 Buy ABNB. Return Since: 17% 1.6.22 Buy Confluent CFLT: Return since: 59% 12.20.21 Sell Healthequity.

INVESTORS PLACE TLDR:  Mostly recommend longterm long shot stocks  Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best  News is wrong sometimes  They are good at spotting longterm trends in where the new money is flowing to e.g. thematic investing online gambling EVs rare minerals etc. I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise. They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks so my tracking here is admittedly biased as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being rightyears from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends e.g. EVs cybersecurity etc. However they also push recommendations based on events or news. I signed up for Matt McCalls Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along longterm thematic investing trends like AI 5G EVs online gambling precious metals crypto data analytics etc. Their basic principal is longterm investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time but since they do longterm investing many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did. Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought: Pct of Recommendations Up: 27% AVG Return: Not able to calculate this since I didnt take advice to hold long term for most EV Maker. Return: 100% I purchased some call options in this EV company name blocked by mods because they made an announcement the company was a shoein to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didnt do my own due diligence stupidly. A few weeks later the award went to Oshkash a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash partnered with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.   7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: 40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting which triggered an increase in price sadly. 1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: 48% The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and Im holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies Novartis AstraZeneca Amgen to get into the Chinese market. In my view it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently. 1.21.21. BUY Block by mod bots: Return: 100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled. 1.22.21 Buy ad company blocked by mods. Return: 76%. My stop loss triggered at 12%. 2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots rare earth minerals company. Return: 32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China. 2.4.21 Buy ACAD  Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: 71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. Im still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs dont hold them. 2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: 60% Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a 20% loss. 2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: 69% Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up 60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled. Feb 2021 Buy ILMN Illumina  genetics company. Return since: 49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each recommendation which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses 28%. 2.19.21.

        "What is the importance of the consumer confidence and JOLT reports today? Given the recent bearish sentiment from last friday if the consumer confidence index comes out lower then expected we can expect it to drag down SPY. Regarding JOLT report I think we are looking at the same sides of one coin. If its lower then expected it will fuel the negative sentiment and if its positive it will support the FEDs narrative therefore the numbers dont really matter. So if the consumer confidence drops today I think puts are in play given overall situation. Does anyone else has any take on this view? Thanks",
        "Perspective matters  comparing swing trading vs buy and hold in between 2002 and 2022 I will make this post short and to the point: Good luck trying to beat the market by doing day or swing trading. I know people who try to do this full time who are smart and have the financial means to buy up tens of thousands of dollars of stock to try and buy then sell shortly after. Every single one of these people has a net loss from starting this. There are 14 of them I know  not a single one has come out ahead. Talk about not beating the odds. Here is the truth r/stocks folks: If you and I were bickering back in May 2002 that AAPL would be dipping from its high of $0.45 we would have been right. AAPL did in fact go down to $0.33 in July 2002. Had you bought puts on AAPL at the right time in 2002  yay for you. If you had tried to swing trade AAPL in 2002 you would have probably gotten burnt but maybe not. Listen: The fact is the best thing you could have done is to have poured $1000 into AAPL at anytime in 2002 and held for the next 20 years until today even with AAPL taking a dip recently. You would have more than 300X you original cash invested. We can do the same thing with the more conservative way of investing ETFs since most experienced investors on r/stocks like these more than individual stocks including myself. Let us take a look at a popular ETF you and I would know as SPY. SPY right now is worth $398. Sure SPY was at $474 back in December 2021 and man it should would have been nice to have sold then. . . April 2002 SPY trading at $119. December 2002 $87. My point with this post is simple: Buy hold and enjoy your life. I am not saying buy and hold crappy high risk companies. Pour 75% of your portfolio in things like SPY VOO and QQQ and dont touch them for decades. Hell dont even look at them. Current positions: 40% in SPY/VOO/QQQ ; 10% in SCHD ; 10% in VT ; 9% in AAPL ; 8% in GOOG ; 8% in SOFI ; 6% in TSLA ; 5% NVDA ; Approx. 4% remaining in cash. Buy. Hold. Live your life.",
        "Why is SPY better than QQQ? New to investing and looking to buy one of these stocks. Why is spy better? I see a lot of people talking about it In my opinion QQQ looks better has a higher percentage of tech and the top holdings look like better companies Any tips before I buy during the dip? I dont have a ton of money to risk",
        "20K gt; 100K In Two Months With Macro and Forward Thinking Did tons of macro economic research in the last two weeks stared at charts to watch volume and understand market sentiment checking 1s order sizes to see larger players enter or exit etc. I timed the top of the market when I saw AMZN  and the rest of the market do a quick jitter down on the day of the top. Other people noticed it too but brushed it off. The medium sized sell made the price of AMZN QQQ SPY etc move down way too much for the size of the liquidation. I took this as a sign of the market being very fragile and oversold so I sold all my AMZN with margin. Next day market started its descent. This caused me to do all the aforementioned research because Ive lost my money before on the first 2022 crash and I understand how important capital protection is now. I decided to be bearish on the market as a whole. I decided that Jackson hole speech would be a catalyst for a huge change in the markets because of what the fed was saying vs how the greedy market was acting and not believing the fed and how they were pricing in a fantasy. Blackrock convinced me a bit too since Im sure they would be greedy if the risk was low but they were ultra bearish. I place my 130P SEP 2 puts two nights before jackson hole unfortunately AMZN went up 2.6% the next day. If this didnt happen I shouldve been up $120k from the beginning. Anyway I kept buying and liquidating my put positions as the market ebbed and flowed down. I stopped today because I saw the inverse of what happened on the top of the market: very very low volume market buys were keeping the market up. The market shouldve been destroyed today with the sell volume but since the top side of the market is all wiped out there are now huge gaps in ask sizes causing it to moon upwards with ease. Another possible $100k day. I was up 35k and I waited out the action until the aforementioned was too strong. Ended at 15k profit for the day. Now ive deleted my trading app and I will time the housing market bottom and buy a nice 3 bedroom house for $600000 CAD with a 20% down payment : Which will be the equivalent to an $800000 house right now preupcomingcrash Thanks for listening to my story",
        "Is TA really even a viable tool? For instance..was anything in TA pointing to SPY going down on Tuesday? Seems to me that stocks are primarily reactionary to Earnings market conditions and sentiment. What was showing in your TA to give you the impression SPY was looking like a bear?",
        "SPGP  Invesco Samp;P 500 GARP ETF After reviewing this ETF I think its a solid choice for a buy and hold strategy. It does have an expense ratio of 0.36% which is higher than SPY amp; QQQ. However since the inception of this ETF it has beat the Samp;P consistently. SPGP has 76 total holdings with the highest holding making up only 2.11%. I like it because it is not heavily invested in a single company and rather its spread out among many different great companies.   Any thoughts? Thanks",
        "Call option strategy on the Samp;P? Considering the following: 1. Call options provide leverage with which both potential profit and loss will be enlarged. 2. The Samp;P500 and Im sure there are other securities has performed netpositive over the long term and I have no reason to doubt this in the future. My question is: If one were to periodically buy long call options in the Samp;P500 e.g. SPY and sell them periodically too would you eventually and/or inevitably outperform the Samp;P500?",
        "Another Head amp; Shoulders Pattern on SPY??? After the previous head amp; shoulders SPY pattern completed yesterday I noticed the bottom yesterday formed a near horizontal neckline with the bottom of July 26.  We have a left shoulder on July 22 just above 400.  So I was thinking today would be a good day to have the right shoulder form especially with the 50 DMA at 401ish. Sure enough SPY got rejected at the 50 DMA and now we have the right shoulder.  To be clear right now this is just a potential hamp;s pattern.  To fully form SPY now needs to drop significantly below 390 which may be where it is currently headed.  To void the pattern SPY would need to rise above 401 significantly.  Heres the exciting part if the hamp;s forms to complete the pattern SPY would have to drop below 350 a new low and a level a lot of bears have been watching.  Im sure this is definitely something technical traders HFs and algos are watching.",
        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 5th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 5th 2022.  Major stock averages slide for third week Nasdaq posts sixday losing streak  Source  gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.  gt; After rallying through the morning the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points or about 1.1% at 31318.44. The Samp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3924.26 its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11630.86 recording its first sixday losing streak since 2019.  gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and Samp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3% respectively while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.  gt; Theres still a lot of nervousness around what well see over the next few months said Callie Cox U.S. investment analyst at eToro. Yes inflation and the job market are coming back into balance but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.  gt; To make matters worse the Samp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone  below its three big moving averages she added. Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now they seem to be ceilings that the index just cant bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this selloff again we also may not reach new highs any time soon.  gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes arent going away anytime soon. Thats put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the Samp;P 500 fails to hold the 3900 level those summer lows could come back into play.  gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report which showed the economy added 315000 jobs for the month just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.  gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% twotenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because its one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75basispoint hike.  gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

DJIA Samp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA Samp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the markets performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. Samp;P 500 is weakest up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.  gt;  Bears Back Above 50% gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak the Samp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the backtoback declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiments eight percentage point weekoverweek increase was the largest since midJune and the third weekly increase in a row. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bullbear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Given the reversal in the spread the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  August Declines All Around the World gt; The end of August is here and US equities as measured by the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY have been on a wild ride. At the midmonth high SPY was sitting on a 4.3% monthtodate gain but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries on average they had reached a 3.13% gain at their monthtodate highs but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24% respectively. In fact there are only two ETFsBrazil EWZ and India INDAthat are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile China MCHI is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum Sweden EWD has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance. gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August most have moved back below their 50DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As we show in the table above this years declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below preCOVID highs as well. At the moment there are only four countries that remain above preCOVID 52week highs: Taiwan EWT India INDA the United States SPY and Canada EWC. This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs and as shown in the chart below each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before preCOVID highs become a technical level worth eying. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds gt; So far in 2022 stocks and bonds have both sold off leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen and partially because of this fact equities have had a tough year. The Samp;P 500 ETF SPY is down 16.0% on a YTD basis while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF AGG has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically rates fall alongside equities as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different though and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a twoweek trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in realtime. gt; Although the 200day correlation between stocks SPY and bonds AGG has been higher once before in late 2009 the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200day correlation sits at 0.87 which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over as illustrated by the chart below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The more we zoom in the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures such as the 100 and 50day correlation coefficients have already moved substantially off of their recent highs even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70 while the 50day coefficient is even lower at 0.55 the lowest levels since midJune and midMay respectively. This tells us that the 200day correlation will likely pull back further thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise and visaversa. As evidence of this today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction theyll each go gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The rolling 100day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 or 50% for 129 trading days which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining the 100day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Continuing Claims Catching Up gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On a nonseasonally adjusted NSA basis the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility assuming normal seasonal patterns NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year this weeks reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture initial claims not turning into continuing claims has completely turned around it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catchup. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Fintech in a recession Hey everyone. Im in mostly SPY and Nasdaq atm. Small position in SoFi and Open. I was thinking about adding more Fintech in this downtrend. Affirm UPST lending Club and a few others but I dont have the experience to fully understand what happens to these type of financial/lending plays in a recession. I get that more people might need loans but there are more defaults as well. Will I be throwing money in a dead sector even at these prices? How do you view fintech short/midterm?",
        "22 years old with small contributions Hello I am 22 years old with a mediocre paying job 45  50k a year while currently enrolled in college. Over the last year I have worked on consolidating and eliminating as much debt as possible as this seems to be the most obvious first step in financial well being. I have worked myself down from 35k debt in car/credit card/ student loan debt to 18k with more student debt on the horizon. I have been dipping my toes in investing for the last year or so and have concluded I cannot dedicate time to researching and DD and have ultimately decided to choose the route of a set and forget DCA plan. With that said I have a toddler as well as normal living costs that do not allow me to invest much. My main priority at the moment is securing an education for a higher paying job. My question is this what do you guys suggest is a smart investment strategy for someone who can only afford to invest 200$ a month? I know it isnt a significant contribution but if anything its a way I can learn as I do. I currently have a taxable account and a Roth IRA through fidelity. My current monthly investments have been 60$ in VOO 10$ in QQQM and 10$ in VTI biweekly through the taxable account and 20$ biweekly in SPY in the Roth account. Any suggestions on if I should be doing this differently? Any advice on how I should set aside money in an investment account for my son? I apologize for my ignorance and thank you for the help.",
        "So how do yall feel about the SPY so far? Do you guys think itd open up or open down? more or less do you guys think itd trade sideways? Weve had alot of bad news over the past couple of weeks including a couple hours before this post iykyk. But for some reason even with the bad news shi still goes up so I just want to know yalls opinion if you dont mind :",
        "SPY QQQ or Both? My brother received a bonus and wants to put the funds into something easy/ straightforward. Told him to put it into SPY and QQQ. Hes on the fence about whether he should go halfsies or all in to either. Are you in either or both? Could you share why you made that choice? What would you do if you were in his shoes? Thanks in advance",
        "Why is it wrong in some peoples eyes to just keep DCA? It seems like if you turn on CNBC or Fox Business the last few days that the sky is falling. The word recession is being used more than any other word if I am not mistaken. Even more than the word tapering or the words interest rate hike. I have several friends of mine who have asked me since the June lows what do I do and my response is 100% of the time dollar cost average for as long as possible. One person has $28k sitting in a checking account with no investments. I told them to withdraw $1k every month and pour it into VOO or SPY until they are down to $5k in checking. We can all disagree on if it would be better for them to just stick $23k of checking into VOO or SPY right now... My other friend is already heavily invested. He is like most people down about 18% YTD and tells me my advice of the past years dollar cost averaging is not cutting it for him. I feel bad he is down 18% YTD but so is almost everyone else. Tell me why if it is that DCA is wrong. I think it is the best way to invest and call me evil in bad times like this year but it just is the best possible route. Both of my friends made me feel small today because they are certain we are going to have a 20% dip thanks to some of the talking heads out there saying things like the soon to come rate hike will lower stocks. Tell me  is this time around different? Should we have all sold in winter when we began to see slippage in the Samp;P 500? My current portfolio: 68% VOO $21000 8% TSLA $2470 7% TQQQ $2100 The remaining 17% is in cash $5250 right now. Should I myself sell everything and wait for a dip? If I do this I will lose out on my dividends payments to come in many weeks for VOO... My one friend said it would be wise to not VOO long term but instead buy the last day I can every few months to get the dividend? Please give me advice.",
        "How much into Roth IRA / personal investments Pretty much all of my investments I put straight into VOO of course as its essentially the same as SPY but with a cheaper expense ratio. So what I was curious about and to make this as simple as possible Ill use 1000 flat if Im putting $1000 flat into VOO each month how much of that should I put into a Roth IRA versus a personal account that I could sell some off if I ever needed it?",
        "Shorts got closed not Margin Call Im aggravated. I had shorts on a iShares NASDAQ100 ETF for a few months. Im in EuropeIncreased that short not long ago and I wanted to hang on to them for some more months as I think the SPY/QQQ will go down allot soon enough. My Broker send me an email that I had to close my shorts the same day.Its not a Margin Call. I had plenty of money in the account.Anyone else ever encounter this?Why was I forced to close my shorts on a ETF that obviously has enough shares in the world. Didnt get an awnser why I had to close my shorts but it cost me money as obviously what I have in mind it months further. They might have followed the rules they made up stating they may close shorts whenever. But I sold all my stocks with that Broker and took my money out.    How am I supposed to make money if I cant hold a long term short",
        "Risk free strategy thats free money or am I misunderstanding Now I literally dont fucking know why this exists. Also please tell me the flaws. So I found SPX and SPY options having the same strike and same expiration but different prices? Now the strategy for this is to sell an option and buy the other for lower same strike risk free. Whats wrong with the strategy? Heres the thing  SPY was at $390.60 and SPX was at 3905.83 VERY similar pricing when multiplying spy by 10 to match SPX. SPY 391c 1dte was at $2.00 where SPX 1dte 3910c was $26 for SPXW. Now Im not making a general assumption but thats a $6 or $600 difference for basically the same option. You can sell the most expensive option and buy the cheapest one. Can someone teach me why this would/wouldnt work? You need at least $390k for the 100 SPXs to do this. I dont know if it works like that. Relatively new to advanced ETF options but if someone contradicts this or points out the flaws I will delete this post",

        "Greedy when others are scared As a data point Im 28. Between my wife and I we probably have $130140k invested today in the market. Reason I say that is because Ive admittedly never experienced any sort of recession as a professional. My question is this...  Im sure weve all heard the greedy when others are scared scared when others are greedy mantra. Is this one of those moments? We are all in different places/ages in life different investment strategies and investing for various reasons but am I crazy for seeing this as maybe my age groups buying opportunity of a life time? Every day CNBC is absolutely filled with fear for valid reasons. Most of my friends have went mostly cash out of fear and I feel like Im the only one buying an uncomfortable amount of stocks like Apple Google MSFT NVIDIA TGT and SPY I have positions in all stated. My cash levels are the lowest theyve ever been. I think Im addicted to buying on red days. My wife I are both in healthcare so job stability isnt the biggest fear of mine. I know no one can give certain answers Im not looking for that. Im more looking for general advice from others that are older and have experienced similar eras as we are in today. Obviously the world we live in today is much different than 2008 and what we are experiencing is caused by different factors but Im sure there are some similarities. Maybe even some shouldve couldve wouldve tips? Thoughts?",
        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 19th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 19th 2022.  Stocks close lower on Friday extending sell off for worst week since June for Samp;P 500 and Nasdaq  Source  gt; Stocks fell Friday as Wall Street wrapped up one of its worst weeks in months and traders reacted to an ugly earnings warning from FedEx about the global economy.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 139.40 points or 0.45% to close at 30822.42. The Samp;P 500 shed 0.72% to end the week at 3873.33. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.90% to finish at 11448.40. It was the worst week for the Samp;P 500 and Nasdaq since June.  gt; Shares of FedEx plunged 21.4% their worst daily drop ever after the shipments company withdrew its fullyear guidance and said it will implement costcutting initiatives to contend with soft global shipment volumes as the global economy significantly worsened.  gt; Transport stocks are typically seen as a leading indicator for the stock market as well as the economy and FedEx pointed to weakness in Asia as one of the main reasons for its negative outlook. Shares of shipping rivals UPS and XPO Logistics dropped about 4.5% and 4.7% respectively and Amazons stock fell 2.1%.  gt; FedExs announcement comes soon after a hotterthanexpected inflation report in the U.S. on Tuesday which raised concerns that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cause a recession to cool prices. That data sparked a decline of more than 1200 points for the Dow.  gt; There is a lot of nervousness about how the global economy can affect the U.S. economy now while the U.S. economy is dealing with its own set of very serious issues. I think that dynamic is what people have woken up to said Callie Cox U.S. investment analyst at eToro.  gt; The three major averages suffered their fourth losing week in five and the summer comeback rally looks increasingly like a bear market bounce. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 4.1% this week. The Samp;P 500 lost 4.8% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped about 5.5%.

Here are the upcoming IPOs for this week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Fridays Stock Analyst Upgrades amp; Downgrades:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK 1  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK 2  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK 3  gt;  What a Way to Start the Weekend gt; If youve been in a particularly bad mood heading into weekends this year youre obviously paying pretty close attention to the markets. With todays decline the Samp;P 500 is in the familiar position of ending the week with a decline of 1% or more. If the current declines hold up into the close it will be the 12th daily drop of 1% or more to end a week this year. Going back to 1952 when the five trading day week started there have only been five other years 1974 2000 2001 2002 and 2008 where there were as many or more down 1% Fridays or last trading day of the week in a given year. As you might expect all five of those years were lousy for the stock market. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While this year is currently tied for having the fourthhighest number of 1% down days the year isnt even threequarters done heaven help us. After today there are still another 15 weeks left in the year so there is plenty of time to move up the rankings. On a percentage basis the Samp;P 500 has closed down at least 1% on the last trading day of the week just under a third 32.4% of the time and if that pace were to keep up for the remainder of the year 2022 would easily set the record for the highest frequency of 1% declines to close out the week. Never have we needed a happy hour more than this year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 Down 25 of 32 Week After September Triple Witching Average Loss 0.89% gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On page 108 of the Stock Traders Almanac see pinned tweet we discuss the Aura of the Triple Witch when stock options stock index options and stock index futures all expire at the same time four times each year. Its important as it usually increases volume and volatility. gt; The week after September options expiration week has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998 2001 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses. gt; Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA 0.98% Samp;P 500 0.89% NASDAQ 0.85% and Russell 2000 1.44%. EndofQ3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter. And next week we have the Fed rate hike decision to contend with. gt; Full stats since 1982 since Samp;P index futures began trading April 21 1982: gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Bad CPI ugly trading but history of 4% daily declines shows good gainseventually gt; Todays hotter than anticipated CPI report was the bad that triggered the days ugly acrosstheboard declines. Surging Treasury bond yields hit NASDAQ the hardest off 5.16% today. Techheavy Samp;P 500 was down 4.32% while DJIA was off 3.94%. Since 1950 Samp;P 500 has declined 4% or more in a single day 53 times before today. In those previous 53 occurrences on the next trading day Samp;P 500 was higher 35 times and lower 18 with an average gain of 1.08% on all days. Based upon historical performance the odds of a gain tomorrow are 66.04%. gt; However the line chart of the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 53 greater than 4% drops does not suggest any significant advance in the nearterm as Samp;P 500 only managed a modest recover on average over the next 2025 trading days a typical month is generally 21 trading days. But the following table does showcase solid gains in the majority of occurrences when looking forward the next 3 6 and 12months. Samp;P 500 was higher 82.7% of the time one year after a greater than 4% daily decline with an average gain over 25%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  11% Annualized  Not Bad for the Worst Trade Ever gt; It has now been 14 years since Lehman Brothers last day as a solvent company  an event that set off one of the biggest market meltdowns of all time. In hindsight the events leading up to and after September 2008 may not seem all that bad. How quickly we forget. Threequarters of a century removed from the Great Depression most Americans had never given a second thought to the safety of the funds in their savings account or even moneymarket funds but shortly after Lehman these were legitimate concerns on the part of all Americans. People were actually going to ATMs and taking out extra cash to literally put under their mattress just in case they woke up and the ATMs werent working anymore. gt; Most of these extremes came after the Lehman bankruptcy but the period leading up to Lehman wasnt a picnic either; thats actually why Lehman went bellyup. From the Samp;P 500s peak in October 2007 through 9/12/08 the Samp;P 500 was down over 20%. But after an early summer selloff the Samp;P 500 rallied from midJuly to midAugust before selling off into Labor Day. Heading into the weekend after Labor Day the Samp;P 500 was down 4% from its midAugust high but appeared to be stabilizing at a higher low relative to July. With the Samp;P 500 still down 20% from its alltime high you couldnt have faulted someone heading into the weekend for thinking maybe Ill try to buy something on sale. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On 9/12/08 stocks may have been on sale relative to the October 2007 highs but any buys on that day would quickly go down as one of the worst trades ever. After Lehman announced its bankruptcy that weekend cracks spread all over the financial district from a Wall Street parched of liquidity. September ended with a decline of nearly 10% but continued to get worse from there and by the following March the Samp;P 500 was down just under 46%  or 71% annualized  from its preLehman close. Stocks that seemed cheap less than six months earlier were now down by nearly half so getting back to even from there would pretty much require a double. Speaking from experience any investor who bought any stocks in those six months quickly felt like the stupidest investor in the world. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While any equity purchases made 14 years ago just before Lehman collapsed quickly turned into some of the worst trades ever time is an investors best friend. Anyone who had time gradually looked less foolish. From a longerterm perspective the decline from September 2008 to March 2009 still looks painful but over time the market as it has to this point always done dug itself out of its hole. The snowball effect of compounding has rewarded investors who were in it for the long haul. Not including dividends the Samp;P 500 has rallied more than 227% since the Friday before Lehmans bankruptcy and including dividends it has delivered an annualized return of more than 11%. Youd probably sign the bottom line as fast as you could for an annualized return of 11% between now and 2036 gt; Not bad for what seemed like the worst trade ever at the time. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Buckle Up Late September Can Be Rocky gt; We are winding down an absolutely awesome time at Carsons Excell experience in Las Vegas. It has been a ton of fun meeting with our advisors learning more about our industry presenting our investment views but best of all making new friends. If you want to come to the very best conference for advisors please be sure to make it next year in Nashville. gt; Heres a quick blog I put together take note Im running on fumes out here that looks at seasonality and why late September and into October is one period that investors need to be aware can be bumpy. gt; Heres a similar chart but it looks at midterm years. Yes right about now isnt historically a bullish timeframe but check out what tends to happen once you get later in the year and past the uncertainty of the midterm election. We are optimistic that history could repeat itself once again. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Zooming in some and it becomes even more clear that late September can be a slide down. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Another look at this is a popular chart weve shared before but it really does a nice job of showing just how weak some of the upcoming days are for the Samp;P 500. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; So buckle up as the calendar isnt doing to any nearterm favors but we remain overweight equities and think the low for the year is in and once we can get past this seasonally weak period a nice end of year rally is quite possible.  gt;  Sentiment Contradicts Price Action gt; The Samp;P 500 may have fallen around 1.5% over the past week but individual investors have reportedly become increasingly bullish. 26.1% of responses to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish this week up from a recent low of 18.1% last week. With the Samp;P 500s worst day in since June 2020 and a hotterthanexpected CPI print occurring late in the response collection period 12:01 AM on Thursday through 11:59 PM Wednesday night the timing of responses is a potential cause for the increase in optimism that was contrary to equities price action. In other words responses that came in prior to Tuesday were likely far more bullish than those that came in afterward and therefore elevating the level of bullish sentiment. As such next week will be a more telling read on individual investor sentiment as it will more fully capture recent price action and inflation data. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While bulls rose back above a quarter of responses bears fell back below 50%. Bearish sentiment dropped to 46% which was only the lowest level since the week of August 24th. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Those moves meant the bullbear spread rose 15.3 points week over week going from 35.2 up to 19.9. That was the largest oneweek jump in the reading since the end of June. However that indicates sentiment remains heavily in favor of pessimism as the streak of negative readings grows to 24 weeks long; the second longest streak of negative readings on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showing a rebound in sentiment. Both the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index highlighted increased bullishness in the latest weeks data. As with the AAII survey though the collection periods likely did not fully capture the effects of Tuesdays inflation data and historic oneday decline. Overall the story remains that investors are remarkably bearish. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  4% Daily Drop with VIX Under 30 Unheard Of gt; Todays bounce back was in line with the stats we posted yesterday but the gains and trading were uninspired. What stuck out was the 4% drop came with VIX below 30 all day. Never happened before. gt; Since 1990 when VIX data began Samp;P 500 had 42 daily declines of 4% or more. Only 8 had a VIX print below 30 and zero that did not have a print above 30. 7 of the 8 opened below 30 and one hit a low below 30 intraday. VIX was below 30 all day 9/13/2022. gt; October 27 1997 Asian contagion mini crash February 5 2018 inflation fear selloff and June 11 2020 Covid second wave scare were oneoffs. The rest were just the beginning of trouble. Triple Witching end Q3 Fed decision Septembers bearish history Octoberphobia midterms could make the comps between now and then a little fuzzy. But September 15 2008 was also Monday of Triple Witching Week  and that brings in the scary 2008 analog into play but thats for another day. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Pain in CPI gt; With investors expecting consumer prices to fall monthovermonth heading into the day this mornings higherthanexpected headline and core CPI reports caused an instantaneous reversal in market sentiment heading into the opening bell. While equity index futures were indicating a gain of around 75 basis points heading into the print after the release indications were for a decline of 2%. When the opening bell finally rang the Samp;P 500 gapped down 2.27% as indicated by the tracking ETF  SPY. gt; Going back to 1998 today marked just the sixth time that SPY gapped down in excess of 2% on the day of a CPI release. As shown in the top of the table below on four of the five prior 2% gaps down on CPI days SPY not only gapped down by over 2% but it continued lower throughout the trading day. While that doesnt necessarily bode well for today we would note that on many of those prior occurrences there were other overriding factors impacting the market. From the Russian debt default and collapse of LongTerm Capital Management LTCM in 1998 to the Financial Crisis in 2008 the US debt downgrade in 2011 and then COVID in 2020 on most of these other days investors had other issues besides inflation to worry about. The only time that there wasnt another major issue impacting the market was on 5/14/99 when headline CPI exceeded forecasts by 0.3 ppts and core CPI exceeded consensus estimates by 0.2 ppts. gt; At the bottom of the table we have listed every other time since 1998 that core CPI exceeded consensus forecasts by 0.3 ppts or more. Todays report is just the fourth time that core CPI has topped estimates by such a wide margin but what stands out most is that every other prior occurrence since 1998 came after COVID. We noted numerous times in the past how COVID has created so many distortions in the economy that the job of forecasting it has become exceedingly difficult and the fact that every beat of this magnitude in core CPI has occurred since COVID only reinforces this point. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Looking for opinion/advice on trading Hey everyone first time poster here. Im looking for some general insight and advice on whether Im on the way to understanding how to get started with day trading and investing in general. Ive invested a measly 50 in two stocks KRC MNTS using freetrade in an ISA just to dip my toes in and get a feel for a trading platform and because from what I see theyre sure to go up in future but of course the gains if any would be next to nothing. Ive also got capital.com and etoro apps for android from what I hear etoro is better but i prefer the UI of capital.com except for the lack of leverage choices which of course I will not be touching for a while. When it comes to the day trading Ive been doing a lot of research online and feel I have a basic understanding of how to identify goid tickers to day trade with. I also have a basic understanding of comparing SPY spread percentage to that of other tickers to get an idea of how well they are doing relative to the market. When it comes to technical analysis of charts thats when I am a bit unsure. I have a basic understanding of resistances and supports swings and the various socioeconomical events that influence them but besides having a few strategies written down from youtube all using a different set of indicators I dont really understand what all the indicators are doing or how I would perform a TA using real world information without the use of such indicators. Am i thinking about this the wrong way misguided/misinformed or am i heading towards having a good understanding on how to trade? Thanks in advance for your responses",
        "I created an opensource automated stock trading platform  I created a framework for creating automated trading strategies using a UI. Using this framework users can create trading strategies combine them to form complex strategies and optimize them to find the best set of hyperparameters. This project is intended for people who want to create strategies using a UI but dont want to use an online service like Pluto It provides a great baseline for a fully functional trading platform. Lastly the system is extensible enough to create custom strategies by extending the AbstractCondition class.   Walkthrough Example This example assumes youve read the README cloned the repo set the environment variables and turned the system on. You will also need to get an API key from Tradier Navigate to localhost:3000 and do the following to create a strategy Register or login You first need to create an account. An important thing to note is that all account information is saved locally. You can put the email as ab.com and the password as 12345678. It doesnt matter as long as you create the account. Register for an Account Creating a simple buyonly strategy Navigate to My First Portfolio then click Edit Strategies Home Page  Dashboard Page Our strategy will spend 100% of our buying power on SPY when any of its buying conditions are met. This looks like the following picture: Simple Strategy Adding buying conditions Our buying conditions in this example will be simple but in reallife can be extended to be a lot more complex. Our strategy will trigger if 1. We have not bought a stock in 30 days 2. SPY is 1 standard deviation below its 30 day average price Click on 0 Buying Conditions gt; New Compound Condition gt; And Condition. Afterwards add the two simple conditions like the following: Adding Buying Conditions Click create then voila Your first trading strategy was created. Backtest your strategy Click the backtest button set a date range and click Run Backtest the strategy Optimize your strategy using a Genetic Algorithm Click the optimizer choose the default settings and click Submit Optimization Page  Update the portfolio with an optimized portfolio Expand an Optimization Vector that has the best evaluation metrics. Click on Buy Spy then click Edit to update your portfolios hyperparameters  Deploy it for papertrading Once we found the best strategy possible go back to the Portfolio Page click Settings click Active then click Save. Now your strategy is deployed for paper trading Deploy the Portfolio  So what did we just did? Using this platform we were able to create a simple trading strategy and optimize its hyperparameters. The optimizer does this by running hundreds of backtests in the backend and continuously evolving the hyperparameters. We were then able to deploy the strategy for realtime paper trading.  Final thoughts While this example was overtly simple we are able to add conditions together create complex strategies and optimize all of them together. This system is over 25000 lines of opensource code and took me over 2 years to develop. It was developed primarily for myself but I thought this system can provide some high quality content for this sub because theres really nothing like it. There you go I hope you guys found this example useful. Thank you so much",
        "My educated inexperienced analysis. Been at this just over 3 months. The market began in a descending wedge when Powell spoke about aggressively combating inflation. Since then any rally has been on false hopes of a soft landing that would be crushed by data supporting the likelihood of us entering a recession. Some traders attempted to make sense of the rallies by saying the Feds are either bluffing not in a position to do it and then up till this week the last hope of a .5 interest rate hike. That is if you believed they were bluffing or that they didnt have the tools to combat inflation i.e strong employment the highest competitive wage market in my young life and the trillions injected into the economy. If you look at SPY which mirrors or inverses all the huge stocks youll see that the market was respecting the 30min 50MA since before Powell spoke. Ever since then it only began respecting the 30min 50MA when it would rally for a false breakout. If you look at the last rally before we confirmed with more data that we will be seeing a .75 rate hike we dropped back under that 30min 50MA in a single day not only did we drop under the 30min 50MA but we also broke back into the wedge we were out of for the largest decline the market has seen in a single day since the pandemic in 2020. In addition to this every single one of those rallies were after dividends payouts. I theorize that the larger money are rolling their dividends payouts into shares at a discounted rate due to tax laws. They are then buying both low and selling high in the form of puts. Each rally is just an opportunity for shares to be dumped on unsuspected traders. Smart money bought 3x the number of puts compared to before the 08 crash at the top of the last rally of hope for a .5 hike followed by a .25 finishing the hikes and decreasing interest rates next year. Since then we have now seen data that absolutely confirms we will be seeing a recession on a global level. Now that the rest of the market is on the same page we only have one place to go and thats down. The Feds not only gave us a .75 basis rate increase but forward projection indicated another .75 followed by a .5 with more to come into 2023. Expectations for 2% are 2025. Also why is September and October historically bad months? Monday October 28th 1929 Monday October 19th 1987 Friday October 24th 2008 get ready to add October 2022 to that list....potentially of course. P.S. a large number of those puts expire Oct 21st 1 week after dividends coincidence? One last rally into more puts before the crash is confirmed? I will say this theory is a bit difficult for me to see because i dont know how anyone could still be bullish enough to tale this up oh yea the algos. Personally any rally at this point seems like a nice opportunity for an EZ ride down on puts.",
        "Question on wash sale I have some capital gains that I would like to offset with tax loss harvesting. Would this scenario trigger a wash sale?

        "Discussion / advice requested on Monday market  tech focus So I originally speculated that the market would bounce down with SQQQ topping 57.5 then a rally back in tech pulling SQQQ down to 52 ish.  Fridays dip buy forwards the end of the day suggested this might be right on track.  The daily candles have a big hammer up on most of the SQQQ tech and up on APPL and SPY.  This was supporting my logic more.  AAPL really seems to want to hold 150.  Las time it went bear through 150 it tested in once and then blasted through.  Anyhow all this news about foreign markets/currency makes me question this logic as a strong catalyst usually outweighs any technicals. Tech might drop straight down without a bounce.

        "If you expect choppy waters in the market why not daytrade a megacap that youd be fine getting stuck with? hold instead of sell 4 loss Let me explain a particular strategy and then you can tell me why its a horrible idea. Ok so lets say that your theory is that there will be plenty of pain in this market till at least Spring 2023 if not longer. However you also know that along the way theres going to be plenty of rallies. Basically youre expecting very choppy waters. Lots of red days but occasional rallies. Lets say youre interested in investing in something like AMD NVDA ADBE MSFT or GOOG for example. Youd have no problem buying these stocks at their current 52 week lows and holding them for 3 or 4 years or even longer. For example you could have bought some AMD today in the very high $62 range. Now you could of course just buy the stock and forget about doing anything with it for the next 18 months. Another option though would be to try to daytrade the stock as much as humanly possible with one HUGE exception. You dont sell it for a loss. Whenever youre down in the stock you convert your mindset to the idea that youre holding for at least 18 months or longer. Now why would anybody want do something like this? Well its back to the choppy waters idea. You believe the SPY will fluctuate from as low as 335 to as high as 405 over the next five or six months. Which means your AMD investment could dive to $48 per share or pop to $78 per share. Just as possible examples. However your strategy would be to simply try to squeeze out very small victories on an intraday basis. I did this exact strategy today with AMD. I made a quick $500. Now making a quick $500 is nice but I put a HUGE amount of money at risk to do it. I could have been stuck as a bagholder of AMD for who knows how long. Now luckily Im super bullish on AMD and would have no problem bagholding at these levels in a worstcase scenario. Although I must admit that if my strategy was to buy AMD and hold for five years Id probably wait for the stock to fall to $55 or $53 or something before jumping in. Yes I believe the stock will trade in this range in the nottoodistant future. Also a huge part of this strategy is not being greedy. When you are doing your daytrading strategy with whatever stock it is youre just trying to bag a half a percent. Sometimes maybe even a quarter percent. So for this to really be that big of a deal youd have to use some serious capital. The downside is that the market tanks really bad and youre a bagholder that thought they got in at an awesome entry. Only to realize a few days later that there was nothing special about that entry and youre now underwater.",
        "Is SPY a completely random gamble? Its a bear market but SPY still randomly has $8 days for no reason at all just to be down $10 the next day. How can we safely bet that spy will go down if it can jump up 5% any given day for no reason? Im trying to profit off the bear market with spy puts but these unpredictable jumps up have cost me.",
        "Whats the opposite of buying the dip? Overpaying/buying at a premium? Is that why its important to buy as much as possible as soon as possible? As a quick example say someone bought a lot of SPY at $400. Buying the dip down seems like it would have been a great idea bringing the average price down. What if instead it went to $410$420$430 etc and theyre buying. Would that be overpaying instead of buying the dip? Seems like something like this doesnt get mentioned enough Eventually its going to be $600 etc shouldnt everyone whos a long term investor be trying to load up now compared to a higher price later? Not necessarily months later but years  Taxable account the way to go for a lump sum?  A Roth IRA where you contribute annually just means buying at a premium it seems on average/long term anyway",
        "This sub perfectly encapsulates why you cant beat the market. Theres a hell of a lot of fear running around whether youd like to admit it or not and all I see on here are people abandoning those ideas that kept getting trotted out during the bull market be greedy/blood on the streets/buy low etc. This sub is far more smug than wsb so its far more infuriating to see here. Lets address the FUD: 1. Dont fight the fed  bullshit. Since the 1950s we have had 13 rate hike cycles  9 of these correlated with up markets 4 correlated with down markets. My point is not to say that this time there wont be a correlation. My point is that NOBODY KNOWS. Link for reference:  2. I see a lot of people going fear/blood isnt here yet etc.  these people will never buy because they are scared. These are people who will say Ill buy when SPY hits 300 but if it actually does theyll 100% go Ill buy when SPY hits 250. These people are scared and have always been like this. Every bear market you hear the same thing. And if youre still not convinced? Look at the fear and greed index  it combines multiple factors including put/call ratios and vix. Currently we are at extreme fear with levels comparable to March 2020 and 08/09. We also see extreme fear in essential nonevents but hey thats human nature. Link for reference:  3. If you invested in xxxx then it wouldve taken you x years to break even  this assumes that you lump summed SPY just before a crash and then never invested again. This applies to almost nobody. But even if you did  if you held you wouldve been fine. Link for reference:  4. All Ive seen this last month are people essentially espousing market timing in an effort to find the bottom or jump back in only when a bottom has been established. But whats wrong with this? On the surface the latter sounds sensible. Again history says otherwise. Bank of America did a study showing what your returns would look like from 1930 if you missed the best and worst days in the market. If you stayed invested since 1930 didnt take out a penny your returns would be 17715%. If you missed the best 90 days out of 21252 so 0.43% of market days your returns drop to 28%. Thats not per year thats 28% over 90 years. Of course if you missed the 90 worst days youd do the best but heres the kicker  80% of the markets best days come within 2 weeks of its worst days. I guarantee you  you cant time that. Link for reference:  So what conclusions do we have? Buffet/Munger/Lynch all say the same thing. History says the same thing. Statistics say the same thing. Ignore the macro. Stick to DCA for indices or valuation for individual stocks. This is financial advice. Link for reference: ",
        "Okay why is SPY green today? Title Edit: what I mean to say is  WHY ISNT SPY SUPER RED So with rising interest rates global recession on the radar and now with OPEC dropping oil production why is spy green today? I understand September might of been too much red so the market could be just taking a breather. However I am quite stunned with the past few days. Other investors must have much more confidence in spy right now than I do.  Can anyone provide their best guess as to why the market is responding positively?",
        "I Traded 3 Opposing Strategies for the Last 60 Days Heres How it Went I decided to run a short experiment for the last month or two testing out a few different strategies to mix things up. In no way did things scientifically this was more an exercise to ease some of my recent market frustration and trade in some different new ways. Here are the three different strategies and how they performed over the last 60 days amp;x200B; Strategy 1 Identifying Potential Trades with Zacks 1 Rank List: I used Zacks 1 rank list as my starting point and then filtered using the VGMvalue growth momentum score. I would sort to view only the stocks with a rating of Abroke this rule sometimes. I did this a few times and would do some DD on the few companies identified then determine whether to make the trade or throw it on a watchlist. Here are a few of my positions and how theyve done: 09/02/22HLIT: 09/02/22  Communication/tech company sol after a few days for 9% 09/02/22BAESY: European defense contractor that won some big contracts recently not much movement exited down 2% 09/13/22CHK: Energy company play that was intriguing down 8% 08/04/2022ESTE: Another energy play here held onto this one for 23 weeks for a return of 7% 08/05/22HOG: Always wanted a Harley probably why this caught my eye  exited after 5 weeks for 10% 08/10/2022PPC: food company down 19% on this one and still holding 08/16/2022SU: Exited this one at breakeven in early oct another energy co from Zacks amp;x200B; Total Return: 3% amp;x200B; amp;x200B; Strategy 2: Trading events with LevelFields Trading on events definitely can be risky and my results here are surely biased due to the stocks amp; events I ended up choosing. I used LevelFields which I like because it filters down news to the events that are significant and likely to affect share prices and separates that from all the endless news. I set it to track buybacks as well as government contracts mass layoffs and some other stuff. This strategy can be rough around the edges but its been a unique way to find some companies to watch that I mightve never seen. 08/03/22RGA: Health insurance co dividend increase trade stock jumped pretty quick regret selling this one for 4% 08/16/22CCRN:Healthcare conglomerate bought on news of buyback sold a bit early here for 7% gain 08/30/22FREY: Traded battery manufacturer on day of news about a $3b contract beginning in 2025. A day or two after took profits at 4.7% 09/07/22TASK: Had been watching taskus for a while pulled trigger on notification of a big buyback. Up 5% in a few days and took some profits 09/06/22COUP: Tried another buyback play here was able to get out even 0% 9/21/22BA: Bearish event but thought Boeing could rally took loss at 8% 9/20/22PLYA: Bought this on newsbuyback fell on news down 9% amp;x200B; Total Return: 3.7% amp;x200B; I enjoyed trading on events and after some early success definitely learned that you have to be careful as it can just as easily go the other way or an event can already be priced in or a hundred other things can go wrong. amp;x200B; amp;x200B; Strategy 3: Buying the Dip This strategy is somewhat of my control and the least scientific. If I noticed the NASDAQ or Samp;P dropping by more than a few percent 35% I would buy the dip. I ended up exiting some of these positions but planning on keeping most and continuing to DCA looking at each trade individually for purposes of calculating return trade by trade. 08/22/22SPY: down 9% 08/23/22QQQ: sold on slight bump down 2% 08/31/22SPY: Positive few days after buying dip sold some SPY pushed towards 410 2.5% gain 09/21/22SPY: Sold after qqq climbed back above 300 after a dip 2% 09/23/22QQQ: About breakeven here 0% gain 09/30/22SPY: Little 5% gain here well see if this will change by end of week Total Return: 4.5% amp;x200B; TLDR: Traded for 60 days in a few new ways to keep things new returns below VGM Zacks 1 Rank List Return: 3% Trading Events LevelFields Return: 3.7% Buying the Dip Return: 4.5% SPY 8.2% QQQ 10.5% amp;x200B; Had some issues formatting so hopefully everything made it in accurately. Edit: Returns are calculated cumulatively counting return of each position at time of writing realized or unrealized then summing the results. All positions sizes are as close as possible to the same",

        "Case Study: Timing the 2008 Bear Market Using the 200 Daily or 40 Week Moving Average The consensus is that you absolutely cant time the market. This common advice is based on a Warren Buffett quote that goes something like this: Any attempts to pick the times to buy or sell I think are a mistake for 99% of the population. And I think that even attempts to pick individual securities is a mistake for people. I think his advice is spot on for anyone who is not interested in playing the investing game and wants to be assured a successful retirement. DCAing into low cost broad based index funds works exactly as everyone thinks it does and doing so ensures your long term success. However there are other ways such as using the 200 day or 40 week moving average. What is the 200 day moving average? Per Investopedia: The 200day moving average is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining overall longterm market trends. Consider the 200 dma a visual representation of the average prices movement. If it is moving higher that means that the average price today is greater than the average price 200 days ago trending up. If its moving lower then the current average price is less than it was 200 days ago trending down.   How do institutions hedge funds and traders use the 200 dma? Per Paul Tudor Jones: I look at the 200day moving average of closing prices. Ive seen too many things go to zero stocks and commodities.

All we can do is recognize which way it is heading RIGHT NOW and adjust accordingly. What is a Trend? Per Investopedia: An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows. Case Study: the 2008 Bear Market Exit Criteria: Price must close below a declining or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average then start a new downtrend by closing below the previous swing low. This eliminates false signals where the price dips below then back above the ma. Entry criteria: Price must close above the rising or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average then start a new uptrend by closing above the previous swing high. Getting Out  Red Flag 1: Spy closed below the 40 week ma several times between July and December 2007 but the 40 week ma was still rising.  Red Flag 2: The 40 week ma levelled off the last week of the year starting 12/30/2007  Exit signal: Spy made a lower low below a declining 40 week ma the week of 1/6/2008 when it closed below the last swing low from 11/25/2007.

        "Olaplex: There may be a recession but dont let it happen to your hair too. Heres some casual DD I did on Olaplex. Figure some people may be interested. The discussion thread did not seem to like it because it wasnt $GOOG. This company has some popular brands that repair your hairs bonds. Qualitative remarks: Visit Amazon Ulta or Sephora websites and look at their hair/shampoo sections and note what the top brands are. For Amazon you might have to explicitly go to shampoo but hair should suffice for the latter two. This companys products are wildly popular on TikTok and in hair salons apparently. They saw some 3B views in their recent TikTok campaign. I am not too worried about a recession. People care deeply about their hair so will pay for premium products if they work. The retail versions sell for $30 while the professional ones are around $200. And hair salons like it a lot.Other luxury/cosmetic companies such as Ulta and EL have had excellent financials in the past even during tougher times. Ulta has crushed SPY in the last decade I am not an expert on hair care so I couldnt say much more about the exact use cases of OLPX. I think people who bleach or color their hair especially use it to repair the quality of their hair. Nevertheless its extremely popular you can visit the hair/cosmetic subreddits to also see it discussed a lot. I also recommend asking your lady friends about it too. Quantitative:  Valuation: The stock has cheapened substantially from its earlier valuations falling 70% YTD while the fundamentals only improved. Currently it trades at a 24 PE trailing and 17 PE forward. EV/EBIDTA is 14. This appears to be about the same or much cheaper than its peers COTY EPC IPAR SKIN NTCO. Those tend to have higher PEs but about the same EV/EBITDA.  Net income growth was 36% y.o.y. in Q1 and 77% y.o.y. in Q2 of this year.  Revenue growth was 58% y.o.y. in Q1 and 38% y.o.y. in Q2.  Balance Sheet: Its cash position is around 200M compared to total long term debt of 700M.  Cashflow: Its FCF positive seeing between 55M to 70M each of the last 4 quarters. Annual cash flows in 2019 2020 and 2021 where: 52.56M 128.95M and 199.15M. Were already at 128M for 2022 with two quarters left to go.

If this was meant to be a place to keep my head down and avoid market volatility it isnt feeling like it.

        "Trading Strategy on Capital Gains/Losses I posted this same question over in /tax and didnt get any actual input.. Has anyone taken this approach?  If so what are the upsides/downsides? I  have $25000 in long term and short term capital gains this year and Im looking at a pretty hefty tax bill.  Between state and federal taxes I estimate Ill owe 25%. Im under the impression the odds are in favor of me day trading.   Theoretically there is a 50/50 the markets will go up or down.  If I buy $100k of SPY for example and only hold it for the day  I  theoretically have a 50% chance of making money.  However if it goes down 1% and I sell I realize a $1000 loss.  This would lower my capital gains to $24000. Instead of me paying the govt $6250 on $25000  Id pay $6000 on $24000.   Which means my 1% loss of $1000 is essentially a loss of 0.75% or $750.  And if it goes up same thing.  I make $1000 and have $750 left over after taxes. As long as I have capital gains is there any downside to this strategy?",

        "Will so many positive earnings surprises fool investors in thinking inflation isnt a problem? Im not so sure seeing ACI JNJ GS and NFLX positive earnings surprises are good news for the market. The increases in earnings may mean that raising prices and inflation will keep getting worse. Not only will more inflation cause Fed rates and QT to increase more but inflation will also increase costs for businesses. The future value of stocks may decline to where the SPY price over earnings is 12 or 15. Interest rates for bonds and borrowers may remain over 8 percent for a long time. Part of the problem maybe that Fed rates are still way below the rate of inflation encouraging people to borrow and spend now instead of later. I wonder when the GDP and GDP Chain Deflator information is released on October 27 if stocks are going to decline to new lows. In the long term stocks dont like inflation.",

        "Individual Stock Purchases vs. ETFs/Funds Here me out A lot of you tout VOO SPY etc. I get it and dont disagree with the logic at all. And the numbers speak for themselves. However Ive been burned a few times on the funds and in general just never been thrilled with the performance in comparison with individual stock ownership. There always seems to be a hole between the market and the fund performance managers getting rich. I also cant help but see that the wealthiest of investors always own their stocks directly except for a handful of obscure market sectors warranting ETFs/ funds. Wealthy investors have more money of course I get that. And ETFs/funds/Robinhood type investments are designed to let everyone invest in a larger pool. I cant even begin with the scam that is Robinhood. As far as the more legit investments such as Samp;P 500 ETFs/funds I cant help but feel like those are still a little scammy arent they? I mean... The portfolios on all of those funds are LITERALLY identical across the board. They LITERALLY purchase the Samp;P 500 at the same %s as the corresponding market share %s. All of which is public information and computer automated not a group of people working tirelessly to make brilliant investment decisions. Between VOO amp; SPY alone I didnt have time to dig into the many others those 2 funds rack up well over $400 Million in management fees/expenses per year. I get that diversification costs money and at the cost of 1 share you can own a piece of 500 companies. The concept is remarkable but $400 million in expenses is a little crazy right? These arent the wealthiest investors paying this mind you this is designed for people who cant afford that luxury. So here are 2 facts I thought Id throw out there 1. Out of the 500ish stocks on the Samp;P 500 only 45 stocks make up 50% of the portfolio for all of these Samp;P 500 ETFs/index funds. 2. If you were to purchase one share of each of the top 45 stocks today it would only cost $8510. This past week Ive started to buy stocks one share at a time. Its nerve racking right now not knowing the bottom of the market. And we are not privy to a lot of information that would clue us in. Not knowing if this is the best time to buy or if the market is going to tank even further which is likely. We all want to buy stocks that will survive any shortterm fluctuation. So I decided to buy 1 share of each stock that I perceive to be a survivor and currently at a sale price. When I looked at the stocks popping up on my list low and behold they largely mirror the Samp;P 500 to a T. Which initiated the rabbit hole I went down in computing these facts...

XLG tracks only the top 50 so its a lot more concentrated:  VOOs top 10 accounts for 27%  XLGs top 10 accounts for 52%  AAPL in VOO is 6.88%  AAPL in XLG is 13.12% My thought process here is that Im young enough early 20s to take on the risk of being more heavily concentrated with the hopes that the top dogs of the Samp;P will outperform the bottom 450. Id love to hear what people think of this idea. I know people say its hard to beat the Samp;P but this seems like a way to just play the Samp;P but with more risk/reward.",

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks since 13th Oct 2022?

        "Selling some stocks for a loss and then DCA into index funds? Im sure a lot of people are stressed out about being down in a lot of stocks such as META or PYPL etc. Does it make sense to just sell for a loss and then allocate that money and DCA into index funds like SPY/VTI? The chances of index funds performing well in the long term seems way more predictable than individual stocks like META or PYPL. So whats the point of holding onto losses in stocks that crashed so much? At this point it seems like DCAing into SPY selling for a loss first has a much better chance of recovering my portfolio than holding onto those individual stocks  And isnt it better mentally to do that? Rather than holding individual stocks that just keeps tanking and tanking? Just transfer all your losses and DCA into SPY and just forget about it rather than keep freaking out all the time.",
        "Current Correlation between US Stocks and Foreign Currencies I have been keeping track of all commodities stocks and currencies for a while and I have noticed a strange correlation that Im unable to explain to myself. Every time the stocks go up there seems to be a weakening dollar move against most major foreign currencies mostly noticing EURO GBP and CAD. There was a slight move up this morning around the time or posting for the USD against others while the SPY dropped two dollars from 402 to 400. A very insignificant change if you ask me but it still baffles me how that correlation exists caused by even the smallest movements on the indexes... Could that possibly be algorithmic behaviour? Still I cant get the reason behind it. Now when the FEDs actually hike the interest rates I can understand the movements between the currencies... But how come the stocks get to have that effect as well? How long has this been happening for? And what are the reasons? Thank you for enlightening me.",

        "We all know about buying the dip so does that mean youre overpaying or buying at a premium when things are going up? People love the sale usually long term investors. I was just thinking the other side of it never really gets mentioned probably since no one wants to admit or think about over paying? As a quick example if SPY is eventually going to be 450 then 500 then 600700 etc isnt the biggest sale now? Why wait until 600 to buy? Time is everything isnt best to throw in as much as possible as soon as possible into a taxable account?

I dont really want to be investing 20 years from now I want to retire in 20 years thanks to 20 years of growth.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 5th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 5th 2022.  Samp;P 500 and Nasdaq end Friday lower after November jobs report; indexes notch weekly gains  Source  gt; Stocks cut much of their earlier losses Friday as investors looked past hotterthanexpected labor data to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up just 34.87 points or 0.1% to 34429.88 points after hitting a session low of more than 350 points down. The Samp;P 500 dipped 0.1% to 4071.70 rebounding from an earlier loss of 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also made up ground to end nearly 0.2% lower at 11461.50 points. The techheavy index dropped as much as 1.6% earlier in the day.  gt; All three indexes set weekly gains with the Nasdaq posting the largest increase at nearly 2.1%. The Samp;P 500 added 1.1% and the Dow ticked up by 0.2%. Fridays close marked the first time the three major indexes notched backtoback weekly gains since October.  gt; Stocks dipped after labor data released Friday morning showed payrolls rose by 263000 in November a bigger gain than the 200000 increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Average hourly earnings also came in above expectations jumping 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% against the same month a year ago. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.  gt; The market quelled much of those losses as the trading day went on. Market observers attributed the move to investors being increasingly able to shake off concerning individual economic indicators following remarks on Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that appeared to confirm slowing rate hikes starting as early as December.  gt; Just one strong labor data point is not going to be enough after Powells speech said Anna Han vice president at Wells Fargo Securities. Hes confirming that we are seeing the trend that we are having an impact on inflation so I think that sort of soothes the market and takes pressure off.  gt; It was the final monthly employment report before the Feds twoday meeting Dec. 1314 in which the central bank is expected to slow to a 50 basis point interest rate hike from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent months.

We ran the numbers yesterday before the big rally on Fed Chair Powells makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases comments yesterday at the Brookings Institute. gt; What we found was that most of the carnage after November YTD losses gt; 15% occurred in the Great Depression years and since WWII December has performed much better after a down gt;15% YTD November. During the Depression after these November YTD gt;15% losses December was down 3 of 4 with an average loss of 5.4%. In the six years since 1939 with these November YTD gt;15% losses December was up 3 down 3 with an average loss of 0.3%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; But with the big 3.1% gain in the Samp;P 500 on November 30 the YTD loss receded above the 15% mark to 14.4% on the heels of a 5.4% gain for the month which is also a 14.1 percent rally off the October 12 low. And this marks the first backtoback monthly gains of over 5% each month since August 2020 the ones before that were in MarchMay 2009. Its the 14th such occurrence since 1950. The previous 13 all occurred in bull markets. gt; Now when the Samp;P 500 is down YTD November less than 15% Decembers performance is not so bad at all just a tad below the average 1.6% to 1.1% up 17 of 23 or 74% of the time. We still expect some chop as the bull market finds its footing but we remain bullish and anticipate the yearend rally to continue to climb the proverbial wall of worry and for the Santa Claus Rally to come to town.  gt;  Country ETFs Outperforming US Recently gt; For most major global equity markets at some point this Fall a 52week low has been put in place with significant rallies since then. As shown below of the 22 ETFs tracking key country stock markets in our Global Macro Dashboard the average gain off the low is now 22%. The largest of these rallies have come from Germany EWG Italy EWI and China MCHI which have all risen over 30%. For China that gain has come in the shortest span of time with October 31st being its low whereas Italy and Germanys lows were a few weeks further back. One other interesting note regarding China is currently it trades only slightly above its 50DMA whereas a majority of other country ETFs are in or at least near overbought territory. On the other end of the spectrum the US SPY has experienced the most modest rally having only risen 13.82%. India INDA is close behind with a 13.89% gain although it bottomed before the rest of the world with its 52week low being back on June 17th. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While much of the rest of the world has experienced a larger rebound off the lows year to date performance between the US SPY and global equities excluding the USproxied by the MSCI All World ex. US ETF CWIis now very similar. The US is marginally in the lead with a 14.12% YTD total return versus a 14.45% drop for CWI. At the lows at the end of Q3 international markets were underperforming the US by more than 5 percentage points but that gap has been closed during the current rally. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Five Good Signs for The Bulls In 2023 gt; Can you believe it? We made it to December As we noted yesterday we wouldnt be surprised if we finished this year with some more green but today well look into the future and what could be in store in 2023. gt; First things first lets start with something simple. Stocks will likely be lower this year; we can all agree there. How likely is the Samp;P 500 to be down two years in a row? The bottom line it is pretty rare for backtoback yearly losses and we dont expect it to happen this time either. In fact over the past 50 years it has only happened twice. There was a threeyear losing streak after the tech bubble burst in 2000 2001 and 2002 then backtoback losses during the vicious recession of 1973 and 1974. So it could happen but we dont see many similarities between now and those two times suggesting next year should be a bounceback year for stocks. gt; Another potential positive is that when the Samp;P 500 is lower during a midterm year like we will likely see in 2022 the following year has been extremely strong. Since 1950 the year after a negative midterm year saw the Samp;P 500 higher all eight times with a very impressive yearly return of 24.6%. Looking at the past 50 years things are even better as the worst next year was 26.3%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Thirdly and somewhat similar to above preelection years historically are very strong for stocks with the Samp;P 500 up 16.8% on average and higher 88.9% of the time. Midterm years are the worst which clearly played out this year. All in all thats something for bulls to be excited about in 2023. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Fourth we hear a lot about how a recession is coming in 2023 but we arent so sure. Sonu did a great job discussing some of this here and here. gt; The bottom line to us is that the consumer makes up 70% of the economy and is still in good shape and spending. But could a recession start next year? Well history would say it would be rare. Thats right we found that out of the past 13 recessions none started in a preelection year. Full disclosure we did see recessions begin in January in 1970 and 2008 so those were just a month away. But all in all this is another potential positive for the bulls in 2023. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly stocks soared yesterday as investors realize that the Fed will likely end their series of aggressive rate hikes potentially quite soon. As a result of yesterdays big move the Samp;P 500 closed above its 200day moving average for the first time in more than seven months. We took a look and this could be potentially quite bullish. gt; As you can see here previous times that saw streaks end at least six months beneath the 200day moving average resulted in solid performance going forward. In fact since 1950 only one out of 13 times stocks went on to make new lows which was in 2002. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are the longest streaks beneath the 200day moving average and what happened once the streak ended. Up 18.8% a year later and higher more than 92% of the time is one thing that could have bulls smiling in 2023. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Will Santa Bring Jolly or Coal to Investors This December? gt; Can you believe it? Weve made it to the last month of the year I dont know about you all but Ill be pretty happy to wish 2022 goodbye as soon as possible. But the good news is that we continue to think the midOctober lows were the lows from the bear market and continued good times could be coming. Ill break down some positive signs tomorrow on the blog but today Ill show why theres a chance Santa will come to town and bring some green with him this December. gt; First things first December is historically known as one of the best months for investors and this is true. Only once did the Samp;P 500 see December turn out to be the worst month of the year. That was in 2018 when the Fed made one rate hike too many and investors werent very festive about things sending December down a record 9.2%. gt; As the chart shows below December is still up over the past ten years so including that massive drop in 2018 and that is mainly because the past three years this final month has gained 2.9% 3.7% and 4.4% respectively. Looking further it ranks as the thirdbest month since 1950 with only April and November better. In fact until 2018 this month was historically the best. Lastly in a midterm year October is the best month November is the second best and December is the third best. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Some other things to know: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. gt;  Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2 gt; The bottom line is that with inflation likely peaking the U.S. dollar weakening positive seasonals a potentially more dovish Fed investors still extremely bearishly positioned bullish from a contrarian point of view broadening overall market participation a stronger than expected consumer and crude oil back to near flat for the year there are many former headwinds which have now become potential tailwinds. When all is said and done with 2022 we wouldnt be surprised to see this year end higher than where it is today.  gt;  A Popular Recession Indicator is Flashing Bright Red. Should We Worry? gt; A political strategist once said that if there were reincarnation he would want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody as he put it. With good reason investors watch bond markets carefully for all sorts of signals about the economy monetary policy and inflation. gt; And right now a key signal from the bond market  the yield curve  is flashing bright red warning about impending recession. The yield curve is simply a curve showing interest rates on US treasury bonds across various maturities. Yields on the short end of the curve i.e. smaller maturities typically rise and fall depending on what investors expect the Federal Reserve Fed to do over the next year or two. Interest rates on the long end of the curve with maturities of 5 years or more are typically higher than those on the short end. If investors anticipate higher growth and inflation they will demand much higher interest rates widening the spread of difference between short and longterm yields. gt; In extreme cases we get inverted yield curves with shortterm rates higher than longterm rates. This normally does not make intuitive sense since it implies that longterm investors who face more uncertainty and risk are settling for less compensation than shortterm investors. It typically happens when the Fed raises interest rates to prevent overheating of an economy like they have this year while bond market investors kind of take the opposing view  believing that the Fed will go too far and push the economy into recession which would be accompanied by much lower inflation and hence lower longterm yields. gt; The yield curve inverted prior to the last ten recessions with just one false signal in 1965. The table below shows yield curve inversions as defined by the 10year/1year spread turning negative along with the timing of the recession that followed. No surprise that this is a favored recession indicator. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below shows how the 10year/1year spread has gone negative prior to the shaded bars i.e. recessions. The bad news is that this spread inverted back in July of this year and is currently at its most negative or inverted state since 1982. Indicating a recession is on the horizon if you consider the historical precedent. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  What does it really tell us beyond Yes Recession gt; One thing you notice from the table and chart above is that while a recession has followed inversion the degree of inversion doesnt say anything about the following: gt;  When a recession will start  the start time has varied from 7 to 24 months gt;  How long the recession will last  we had prolonged recessions in 1974 and 2008 and the degree of inversion was quite different prior to these gt;  How deep the recession will be  the degree of inversion was similar prior to the 2001 and 2008 recessions but these were very different economic drawdowns gt; Another huge caveat I would add to the track record: the inversion in 2019 technically preceded the 2020 recession but it didnt really predict it in that it didnt predict Covid19. gt; Also the yield curve has a bit of a dubious record outside the US as this study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve points out. Several yield curve inversions occurred in the U.K. and Canada that did not predate recessions i.e. you had a lot of false signals. But it worked better in the US France and Germany. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  A symptom rather than a cause gt; Yield curve inversion is more of a symptom rather than a cause. The logic is that the Fed tightening too far leads to an expectation of slower economic growth or recession which leads to lower inflation expectations theres less demand for goods and services. Which in turn results in longterm yields falling below shortterm yields. To a first approximation longterm yields are simply the expected path of future shortterm rates i.e. monetary policy. And so if inflation is expected to be lower in the future especially amidst a recession you would expect the Fed to reduce rates. gt; Note that higher rates can take their toll on the economy. For example housing activity can decline amid higher mortgage rates and businesses may cut back on spending/hiring if they find borrowing terms to be much higher. But these usually occur only with a lag  which is why a recession doesnt follow immediately after the Fed raises rates and yield curves invert. gt;  Look toward inflation expectations gt; With respect to yield curve inversions a lot of it comes down to inflation expectations. Inflation expectations can fall if investors expect a recession. gt; But longerterm inflation expectations can also be lower than shortterm inflation expectations if inflation has surged recently and investors believe it to be a shortterm phenomenon. Sound familiar? gt; Its not easy to directly gauge inflation expectations but we can calculate them using securities called inflation swaps. Without getting into too much detail these are used to transfer inflation risk from one entity to another. You have swaps ranging over various periods e.g. 1 2 3 5 and 10 years which can tell you what investors expect inflation to average over these periods. gt; The chart below shows 1year inflation expectations versus 1year/9year forward inflation expectations. The latter is the inflation expectation over the 9year period that begins one year from now  my goal is to separate shortterm inflation expectations from longerterm expectations. As you can see 1year inflation expectations surged above longerterm expectations over the past 1820 months. Prior to 2021 the 1year/9year forward expectation was mostly above the 1year. But theyre converging again with investors expecting inflation to average about 2.7% over the next year. At the same time the 1year/9year forward expectation is just under 2.6%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; What also comes out of the graph is that during the 2008 and 2020 recessions 1year inflation expectations collapsed well below the longerterm series. Based on that it doesnt look like markets are expecting a recession now. gt;  1year inflation expectations are still slightly above the 1year/9year forward inflation expectation gt;  1year/9year expectations have barely fallen in contrast to what we saw in 2008 and 2020 when they were below 2% gt; Could we be headed for stagflation i.e. a recession with high inflation? Well the 1year/9year forward expectation is around 2.6% right now  it doesnt exactly scream stagflation let alone high inflation. gt; To wrap up the yield curve may be as inverted as it is today because the Fed is hiking shortterm rates even as longterm yields fall on the back of lower inflation expectations  in a sense vindicating the rate hikes. However there are other factors including a reversal of supplychainrelated issues that pushed inflation higher in the first place. My colleague Ryan Detrick and I have written quite a lot about why we think inflation is off the boil see here and here. gt; And just as important inflation expectations beyond a year are not pointing toward a deflationary recession or stagflation for that matter. gt; Of course investors could be wrong and things could change in a hurry. This is something Ill be watching closely.  gt;  Typical December Seasonal Pattern Begins Dull Pops MidMonth gt; Decembers first trading day has been bearish for Samp;P 500 and Russell 1000 over the last 21 years. A modest rally through the fifth or sixth trading day also has fizzled going into midmonth. It is around this point that holiday cheer tends to kick in and propel the indexes higher with a pause near monthend. gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month early January Effect 2023 Almanac pages 112 amp;114. The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer 2023 Almanac page 18 which states as the Samp;P 500 goes in January so goes the year. gt; The Santa Claus Rally begins on the open on December 23 and lasts until the second trading day of 2023. Average Samp;P 500 gains over this seven tradingday range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. The Santa Claus Rally 2023 STA p 118 was invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac. gt; This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally SCR has failed to materialize are often flat or down. As Yale Hirschs now famous line states If Santa Claus should fail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  December 2 Small Cap 3 Large Cap Tepid Start Solid Finish gt; Trading in December is holidayinspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However the first part of the month tends to be weaker as taxloss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. gt; December is the number three Samp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950 averaging gains of 1.5% and 1.6% respectively. Its the secondbest Russell 2000 1979 month and fourth best for NASDAQ 1971. It is also the third best month for Russell 1000 1979. gt; In 2018 DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 does not seem highly likely this year. gt; When December is down it is usually a turning point in the marketnear a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December stocks can pullback in the first half of the month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In the last eighteen midterm years Decembers rankings slip modestly to 5 DJIA 0.9% 3 Samp;P 500 1.2% and 7 NASDAQ 0.3% since 1974. Small caps measured by the Russell 2000 also tend to soften in midterm Decembers. Since 1982 the Russell 2000 has lost ground just three times in ten midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is 0.3%. Midterm December performance had been stronger prior to previously mentioned December 2018.

        "Realizing Losses to Offset Gains I have a large amount of stocks that have pretty much gone into the toilet and are expected to be there for a long time. Id like to sell a bit of them to harvest the capital losses. I have some SPY index funds that have about 10% unrealized gains. I dont need to liquidate my stocks for any cash. I was wondering if I should sell a bit of SPY to realize the gains realize the losses in my garbage stock and repurchase SPY again right after? I know theres some caveats with wash sales but that seems to only apply to losses which wouldnt be applicable since Im repurchasing SPY. I will also probably hold onto SPY for another year so no concerns with waiting them out to become long term capital gains again. Anything to be aware of?",
        "Question on options taxation I opened a credit spread on SPY couple of weeks back and closed it yesterday for a total profit of 66$. In one leg the profit was $9532 and in other leg loss was $9466. If I now do a cash secured put on SPY and get it assigned would the loss be considered a wash sale and disallowed from tax deductions?",
        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022.  Dow tumbles 300 points Friday posts worst week since September  Source  gt; Stocks finished lower Friday with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points or 0.9% to close at 33476.46. The Samp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3934.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11004.62.  gt; On a weekly basis the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The Samp;P tumbled 3.37% while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.  gt; Fridays moves came after Novembers producer price index showed higherthanexpected wholesale prices which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI which excludes food and energy also topped expectations.  gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears but attention remains laserfocused on next weeks busy economic calendar.  gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.  gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Feds aggressive tightening stance but the data fails to support that desire said Stephanie Lang chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.  gt; Its our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers she said. Theres still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.  gt; In other news shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weakerthanexpected fourthquarter outlook. DocuSign jumped on strong results.

Since 1982 DJIA has advanced 30 times during Decembers options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. Samp;P 500 has a similar although slightly softer record. gt; However the record is not pristine. Last year accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018 DJIA and Samp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011 Europes debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012 the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after. gt; Going into next week the markets bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%4.50%. Todays slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  More Positive Signs for Inflation gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022 and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest most important economic event of our lifetime aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday today well look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing. gt; First up the consumer price index was up more than 9% yearoveryear in June but has since come back to 7.7% and we expect the trend to continue lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people arent paying as much for stuff there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows services prices have been more stubborn but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43 cut in half from March. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year but should it turn lower it could be a nice tailwind. Although the governments data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year and the trend remains firmly lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month so safe to say this is a widespread trend. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Once again government data lags behind private data and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases while private indices consider just new ones. Also for the official data rental units are sampled only every six months given that rents arent renegotiated very often. For this reason we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 812 months. gt; Additionally CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% backtoback months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth. gt; Lastly used car prices continue to sink. According to their data the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down yearoveryear 14.2% the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices the governments data tends to be slow to get with the picture so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the governments data more over the coming months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared we think it could come back down in 2023 and things like rents prices paid and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This of course would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.  gt;  Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings gt; Sentiment tipped over before the Samp;P 500s rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This weeks reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% a reading in the middle of this years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Overall sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 SPY December Drop gt; The Samp;P 500 SPY has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally SPY did manage to move back above its 200DMA but it couldnt quite get above the past years downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today and while further declines could result in a break down it would also mark an impressive but not exactly unheard of streak of declines. As shown below it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact this months 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY since inception and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines both of those previous instances saw larger drops roughly around 4.5% than the 3.5% decline currently. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2  gt;  Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day. As shown below SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy XLE is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary XLY and Financials XLF. Utilities XLU is down the least so far in December at just 0.50%. gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The AllWorld exUS ETF CWI and the Emerging Markets ETF EEM are both down just 1.2% MTD and the AllWorld exUS ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence. gt; For most of the year heading into December we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks but recently as stocks have dropped bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month with the 20 Year Treasury TLT up the most at 4.35%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below of the yeartodate percentage change total return of the Nasdaq 100 QQQ and the 20 Year Treasury ETF TLT is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month QQQ is down 3.98% while TLT is up 4.35% but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  BacktoBack Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Chances are you have already heard about the Samp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest Samp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance followed by 8.0% in October 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable up 13.79% in two months. gt; Based upon the Bull amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Traders Almanac all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020 2009 2002 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish but choppy during the 1month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21year Seasonal Pattern for December. gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the Samp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 1520 trading days after the streaks end. Following this period the Samp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1year after the streak ended.ail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  When does the Santa Claus Rally Start? gt; As we noted on the blog last week December is historically a strong month for stocks and we dont expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the thirdbest month for the Samp;P 500 since 1950 April and November are stronger and thirdbest during a midterm year with October and November better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt; Taking things a step further though when does Santa come to town? One of the most wellknown investment axioms is the Santa Claus Rally and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December but this isnt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me given that this is when Santa comes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

Dow closes more than 200 points lower falls for a second straight week as recession fears grow  Source  gt; Stocks dropped Friday building on their yearend selloff as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points or 0.85% to 32920.46. The Samp;P 500 fell 1.11% to 3852.36. Meanwhile the techheavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10705.41.  gt; The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The Samp;P 500 fell 2.08% for the week and putting its December losses at 5.58% as hopes for a yearend rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7% respectively.  gt; Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring the highest amount relative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points before paring back some of those losses.  gt; The selloff was broadbased with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point there were only 10 Samp;P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards down nearly 3% and 1.7% respectively.  gt; Stocks fell this week in the wake of the Feds 50 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday  the highest rate in 15 years. The central bank said it would continue hiking rates through 2023 to 5.1% a larger figure than previously expected.  gt; Following the policy update the Dow dropped 142 points on Wednesday plunged 764 points Thursday and declined further on Friday.  gt; At the beginning of the week we had the hope given the very soft CPI number that we could expect the Fed and maybe the other central banks of the world to be less hawkish Bokeh Capital founder Kim Forrest said.  gt; But because they didnt and they had some stern words for investors and consumers alike that they were really focused on getting inflation down quickly that has taken away a lot of our hope for a soft landing Forrest added.

I can see Yales big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street. gt; They argue their case for why the Santa Claus Rally will or wont come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972 published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord it is still misunderstood. Its not a trading strategy its an indicator gt; SCR is the short sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Samp;P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year. gt; To wit Yales famous line: If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call Bears May Come To Broad And Wall. Stock Traders Almanac 2023 p 118. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. Its working inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while. gt; But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge. gt; Stocks tend to bottom here in midDecember ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month especially small caps  what used to be the January Effect. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our January Indicator Trifecta the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972 will help solidify our outlook for next year. gt; When all three are up the Samp;P 500 has been up 90% of the time 28 of 31 years with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the years results are reduced and when all three are down the Samp;P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of 3.6% with bear markets in 1969 11.4% 2000 10.1% and 2008 38.5% flat years in 1956 2.6% 1978 1.1% and 2005 3.0%. Down Trifectas were followed by gains in 1982 14.8% and 2016 9.5%. gt; Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our January Indicator Trifecta FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit. gt; We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks the Sweet Spot of the 4Year Cycle Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of preelection year.  gt;  5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets gt; I am an optimist because I dont see the point in being anything else. Abraham Lincoln gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market today I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets. gt; First things first we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023 which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here. gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market we are using the traditional definition which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes there isnt much difference between 19.8% and 20.0% so we will also include some near bear markets as well but when we say bear market that is what we mean. gt; First do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they dont as stocks indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987 which all took place without a recession. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Second taking things a step further here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some near bear markets this time to get more instances. Plus a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24% and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low this was right on the bullseye. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact the last three bear markets that didnt have a recession recovered in four four and three months. Something to think about here as stocks are two months off the October lows. gt; Third this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023 this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly bears dont end for another nine months on average after the recession started before they find their ultimate low. Again we dont see a recession so this wouldnt be the case now but the data is quite compelling. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Fourth the month of October tends to be a bearmarket killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October more than any other month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Below we break down those previous 17 bear or near bear markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October and we think theres a very good chance number seven just happened. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Fifth and lastly if October was indeed the bear market low be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bearmarket lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022 it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term. gt; Dr. Seuss said Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple. To me bear markets can be confusing and complicated but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end and historically better times will come when they do.  gt;  2022 US Stock Market Snapshot gt; With just a couple more weeks left in the year the Samp;P is down 18.2% yeartodate which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below weve seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If Decembers declines hold well have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has so far been the worst month with a decline of 9.3% while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance Mondays Thursdays and Fridays have averaged declines this year while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Energy Losing Its Grip gt; You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? Thats what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the Samp;P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the Samp;P 500 has moved higher. Last week the sector broke below its 50DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50DMA on 12/6 the sector has made multiple intraday attempts including today to get back above it but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level its often a sign of a momentum shift. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; On a relative strength basis the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the Samp;P 500 SPY over the last year. During that time Energys relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week but at this point the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months so its only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well but with the sector already breaking below its 50DMA this is a key trendline to watch. If the sectors relative strength weakens further the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldnt shed a tear for. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE  gt;  The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023 gt; First the good news  gt;  The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points bps to the 4.254.50% range  a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected but its always good to see confirmation. gt;  They also said that ongoing rate increases will be necessary and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023 which was not a big surprise. Whats important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021 they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6%  1% increments every three months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The notsogood news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy which wasnt great. gt;  They revised economic growth lower from 1.2% to 0.5% 2023 gt;  They revised the unemployment rate higher from 4.4% to 4.6% about 1% point higher than where it is now gt;  They revised core inflation higher from 3.1% to 3.5% 2023 gt; While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they dont believe these forecasts qualify as a recession keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession. gt; But if you notice I said not so good news instead of bad news. Powell pointed out that these are members best estimates as of today but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting when they update the projections again we have three more inflation reports three employment reports and an employment cost index report which is a preferred gauge of wage growth. gt; If you look back at the previous chart weve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. Theres no reason to think we wont see more revisions if the data cooperates. gt;  The shift: From how fast and how high to how long gt; The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve Fed looked to get on top of inflation. The Feds singular focus was to ensure they did more than enough to lower inflation. Consequently the overarching question on investors minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates and how high they would go. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; I believe thats going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didnt mention it again in his postFOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that while the report was encouraging they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so theyll keep rates sufficiently restrictive. gt; I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023 especially if energy prices dont spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents which are falling rapidly. All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen. gt; So the question for investors will also shiftfrom how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line  there may be fits and starts and false alarms but the trend is clear. gt;  The risk of transitory deflation gt; What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services education childcare costs wireless services insurance fees etc.  all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As you can see the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about how long to stay restrictive. gt; I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.  gt;  Is Anyone Bullish? gt; The future aint what it used to be. Yogi Berra gt; Weve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago the future aint looking too good. gt; The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Heres a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Adding to this for one of the first times ever Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the Samp;P 500 next year. That just doesnt happen or it didnt happen until now. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Weve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday I saw this headline adding to the festive mood. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are two more signs of nearhistoric levels of skepticism. First the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words lower than the financial crisis and COVID. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Second our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index IMX which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again not a lot of excitement out there. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Theres an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or as General Patton said If everyone is thinking alike somebody isnt thinking. gt; What could spark it? Itll likely be better trends in inflation which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here. gt; It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The Samp;P 500 was down two years in a row in 73 and 74 one of the worst recessions ever then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s thats it. Even during the financial crisis stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009. gt; As the table below shows it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror as what just happened likely wont happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year likely where we land in 2022 they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now to be clear we arent saying stocks will gain 25% next year But we are saying it isnt as crazy as it sounds. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Warren Buffett said Someones sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. Things havent been good for investors this year but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.  gt;  VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for Samp;P 500 over Next 2 Weeks gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On Friday December 9 a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index VIX. A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like Samp;P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure nearterm market volatility the lower it goes the better the Samp;P 500 usually performs. Thus a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication. gt; Going back to 1990 including the most recent cross there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The Samp;P 500s average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross Samp;P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross Samp;P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days. gt; Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross the 50day moving average crosses above the 200day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for Samp;P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later. gt; In following tables we present the Samp;P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the nearterm 1and 2week Samp;P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross but by 1month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the nearterm but not a great indication much beyond 2weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "US vs UK/EU ETFs return on investment Global/EU/UK vs US only ETFs selection I have a question regarding choice of ETFs. From the past 5 year data on yahoo finance SPY/VUSA returns seem to out perform any UK EU or global ETF I can find. I get the increased risk with volitlity of a strong dollar to  exchange rate and that there is increased risk with simply backing a one country market but do the increased returns albiet from a  limited historial dataset not outway these risks? Maybe I am looking at the wrong ETFs? Or leaning too much on short term historical data for evidence? I would love your input on this or suggestions to any nonUS ETFs that have good potential for a similar return to that of the SPY. Thank you",

        "I Traded 3 Opposing Strategies for 60 Days in 2022 Heres How it Went I decided to run a short experiment for the last month or two testing out a few different strategies to mix things up. In no way did things scientifically this was more an exercise to ease some of my recent market frustration and trade in some different new ways. Here are the three different strategies and how they performed over the last 60 days amp;x200B; Strategy 1 Identifying Potential Trades with Zacks 1 Rank List: I used Zacks 1 rank list as my starting point and then filtered using the VGMvalue growth momentum score. I would sort to view only the stocks with a rating of Abroke this rule sometimes. I did this a few times and would do some DD on the few companies identified then determine whether to make the trade or throw it on a watchlist. Here are a few of my positions and how theyve done: 09/02/22 HLIT: 09/02/22  Communication/tech company sol after a few days for 9% 09/02/22 BAESY: European defense contractor that won some big contracts recently not much movement exited down 2% 09/13/22 CHK: Energy company play that was intriguing down 8% 08/04/2022 ESTE: Another energy play here held onto this one for 23 weeks for a return of 7% 08/05/22 HOG: Always wanted a Harley probably why this caught my eye  exited after 5 weeks for 10% 08/10/2022 PPC: food company down 19% on this one and still holding 08/16/2022 SU: Exited this one at breakeven in early oct another energy co from Zacks Total Return: 3% amp;x200B; Strategy 2: Trading events with LevelFields Trading on events definitely can be risky and my results here are surely biased due to the stocks amp; events I ended up choosing. I used LevelFields which I like because it filters down news to the events that are significant and likely to affect share prices and separates that from all the endless news. I set it to track buybacks as well as government contracts mass layoffs and some other stuff. This strategy can be rough around the edges but its been a unique way to find some companies to watch that I mightve never seen. 08/03/22 RGA: Health insurance co dividend increase trade stock jumped pretty quick regret selling this one for 4% 08/16/22 CCRN: Healthcare conglomerate bought on news of buyback sold a bit early here for 7% gain 08/30/22 FREY: Traded battery manufacturer on day of news about a $3b contract beginning in 2025. A day or two after took profits at 4.7% 09/07/22 TASK: Had been watching taskus for a while pulled trigger on notification of a big buyback. Up 5% in a few days and took some profits 09/06/22 COUP: Tried another buyback play here was able to get out even 0% 9/21/22 BA: Bearish event but thought Boeing could rally took loss at 8% 9/20/22 PLYA: Bought this on newsbuyback fell on news down 9% Total Return: 3.7% I enjoyed trading on events and after some early success definitely learned that you have to be careful as it can just as easily go the other way or an event can already be priced in or a hundred other things can go wrong. amp;x200B; Strategy 3: Buying the Dip This strategy is somewhat of my control and the least scientific. If I noticed the NASDAQ or Samp;P dropping by more than a few percent 35% I would buy the dip. I ended up exiting some of these positions but planning on keeping most and continuing to DCA looking at each trade individually for purposes of calculating return trade by trade. 08/22/22 SPY: down 9% 08/23/22 QQQ: sold on slight bump down 2% 08/31/22 SPY: Positive few days after buying dip sold some SPY pushed towards 410 2.5% gain 09/21/22 SPY: Sold after qqq climbed back above 300 after a dip 2% 09/23/22 QQQ: About breakeven here 0% gain 09/30/22 SPY: Little 5% gain here well see if this will change by end of week Total Return: 4.5% TLDR: Traded for 60 days in a few new ways to keep things new returns below VGM Zacks 1 Rank List Return: 3% Trading Events LevelFields Return: 3.7% Buying the Dip Return: 4.5% SPY 8.2% QQQ 10.5% Had some issues formatting so hopefully everything made it in accurately. Returns are calculated cumulatively counting return of each position at the time of writing realized or unrealized then summing the results. All position sizes for simplicitys sake are assumed to be the same size. Didnt do this to reach any significant conclusion with this tiny sample size did it more as a fun experiment next time Id like to try a fun inverse strategy off of certain pundits/analysts and or poor stockpicking services open to other weird ideas",
        "Is SFY too similar to VTI? Wash sale question I have some $ tied up in SFY ETF please note I do not mean SPY. I also have VTI. I want to sell my position in SFY and move some of that money to VTI while holding the rest in cash for the time being. Is SFY gt; VTI close enough to trigger a wash sale?",
        "Humble opinion 2: Four signs market may have bottomed This follows my first humble opinion:  The fact that it received so many down votes is a good sign. I maintained the same sentiment: Bottoms reached for SPY and QQQ on 13 October 2022. Bottoms reached means that the 52w low on 13 Oct 2022 will not be significantly breached. Today I present four more signs that market may have bottomed using 2008 crash as a case study. All news articles listed here were published between February to March 2009 just before one of the largest bull market in history. Sign 1: MSM tells you all hopes are lost. Heres an article suggestion to millennials its better to become pirates piracy is the only growth industry left. Forget Wall Street You Can Be A Real Pirate  Sign 2: The most hated guy in the market is trying to doom the economy and you. Obama Declares War on Investors Entrepreneurs Businesses And More  Sign 2 alternative: The most hated guy in the market said he is trying to help the economy and you. Heres an example Obama was telling people to buy stocks literally just before the huge bull market. Obama: Buy stocks now  Sign 3: The Big Boys finally succumbed to cutting jobs. Heres an example. Bloomberg L.P. Cuts 100 Jobs a First for the Company  Sign 4: The wrongest guy in the market gets called out in anger except this time hes finally RIGHT. CNBC Jim Cramer Repetitive Bear Market Bottom Wrong Calls  amp;x200B; Fast forward to 2023 there are many similarities but change the date and change the most hated guy in the market to J Pow. The wrongest guy is still the same. Happy 2023 to you all",

I just realized the losses to offset the gains for tax purposes. I understand I cant rebuy the specific stock for 30 days but can I just invest in index like VOO or SPY for the next month or so?

To be clear Im not looking to hold bond ETFs for the longterm but I would like to park money in them for the nearterm in case the general equity indexes go down a lot say SPY to below 380 and then start moving money from bonds to indexes like what bonds did in early to mid 2020.

        "Compound interest if SP500 Hello this seems so simple but Im having a hard time wrapping my head around a concept as it relates to compounding interest and investing in the SP500.  With compounding interest given an annual compound rate of 9% it seems that an investment of $10K 30 years ago would be worth $132677. However if I were to invest $10K using SPY for my historical return over the last 30 years that investment would be worth around $77000. I know ones hypothetical and ones based on history but I cant seem to pinpoint the disconnect. And to add some more info the reason Im wondering is because Ive been looking at what an investment today into the SP500 would be worth in 45 years. Considering an annual return of 810% the growth seems insane over that time. However when I look at the historical return of SP500 funds and what my return would be over that same timeframe its not even close. Thanks for any thoughts or clarification you can provide",

        "Arbitrage Opportunity with IWM and SPY  During times of economic uncertainty or in high inflation environments RUT has a tendency to outperform the SNP500.

Currently RUT/SPX value stands at 0.4604 with 0.6461 being close to the high. With the earnings of GOOG and MSFT being perceived as a beat last evening by the market the value will probably go slightly lower at todays open making it an even better entry point.

        "100% of my Roth is in a single stock Update on 100% ROTH in 1 stock I did not expect the amount of response on my original post I think when originally creating the post and being new to the sub that it wouldnt garner much attention in my lack of detail I think some missed key points of my original discussion. AMD which was 100% of my portfolio in my ROTH but only 10% of my overall investments I thought that having it in my ROTH would be really beneficial as I can avoid taxes however after reading hundreds of responses there are many more disadvantages to having a concentrated portfolio of any kind.  Inability to claim losses to offset capital gains tax  6000 contribution limit makes it very costly in any loss scenario as with a 10% average market appreciation 6k over many years and diversified will always yield positive returns where as an individual stock is gambling. I was given the advice to move AMD to my retail account where Ive held my full 102 share stake but Ive sold ETFs and now my ROTH IRA is 100% SPY until I have more time to find ETFs that diversify my portfolio with less expense rates as there are many funds I wasnt currently aware of. Another tip given by a CFP Certified Financial Planner is that I max my 401k but instead of using my pretax traditional 401k I just do both roth. Swapped PreTax 401k traditional to Post Tax Roth 401k  Changed my 401k contribution to the maximum allowed while taking the most advantage of my employer match I originally thought I was making the smart play by avoiding taxes but in reality I was going to pay more taxes if I ended up losing money because I could no longer recoup my losses against my capital gains. It was also brought to my attention that some thought a 25% concentration in Ethereum was a lot which I do agree as it heavily correlates with tech it isnt liquidable because its staked so I have no way of moving this allocation around but I plan on lower it to 10% and adding to my brkb and taking a stake in some dividend etfs once I do more research. Ill do a complete portfolio explanation once I have time to research and find a mix that I think suitably diversifes risk while giving exposure to more sectors. Thanks for the advice everyone. I appreciate it also I didnt wake up until 10am so I made a little extra profit in my ROTH before I sold : If anyone has any advice on ETFs to research or constructive criticism Im all ears I know some critized me selling covered calls against my shares to reduce my risk if anyone else has any ideas to hedge my risk in a more profitable way Id love to learn.  Update: Im going to sell a call for my target price a month out if the guidance is bad Ill use the premium decay to recover some losses if its good then Ill either be called out or roll my call over to whatever I see as my new price target each month. Wish me luck : Im 23 years old and make around 80000100000$ a year just recently started putting money into a  Roth IRA last year right now I have 9600 in AMD stock and I really like the stock. Ive traded a few stocks here and there but AMD is my top stock to own right now I put 7% of my paycheck into my 401k from work and save around 90% of my money in long term investments. I only have the Roth IRA to really invest in my own opinions the others are all just ETFs in my other accounts.    What do you guys think about having 100% of a Roth IRA in a single stock?    I like to trade in Roth IRA because of tax advantages and ability to withdraw deposits.     Please dont clown on me I just am genuinely curious as to how others older than me balance their  IRAs and if anyone had bad/good experiences in their life with it.   Also yes I sell covered calls against my shares every week. Usually I just buy the farthest out OTM option that has some kind of free premium because I really dont like getting called out of my shares and 3$/week is better than nothing I suppose.",
        "How are /ES futures not too good to be true / a scam if they only take $6k$12k in margin to get 50x SPX exposure which would take $250k worth of SPY to achieve gt; For example if an Emini Samp;P 500 Index futures contract /ES has an initial margin requirement of $6600 and a maintenance margin of $6000 buyers or sellers must have $6600 in their account to enter the contract and need to keep at least $6000 in their account to stay in the position.  gt; So for the cost of $2 in commissions you can risk $4$6k of your account to get control of $100k worth of Samp;P.  So if the Samp;P goes up 1% and becomes $101k  you just made $1k on your $5k margin investment  thats a 20% return on capital  I feel like this can be super dangerous for the average retail investor who wants big returns but has little cash sub $20k. Is that why this product exists? Is it almost predatory to get people to risk $10k of their net worth and get themselves into way too deep/hot risky water? Im not here to debate how risky margin/leverage let alone 1 SPX point being $50 per contract. I just feel like... its too good to be true? Not only that... you cant do wash sale trade tax writeoffs with equities but you can with futures and they are taxed more advantageously than equities gt; In the United States futures contracts are subject to the 60/40 rule. This advantageous tax treatment also applies to day trades and is broken down into two parts: 60% profits  taxed as longterm capital gains. 40% profits  taxed as shortterm capital gains. gt; For options and futures contracts the wash sale rule applies to losses from the trades or sales of options and contracts to sell or acquire stocks or securities. It does not apply to losses that you incur from trades or sales of commodity futures contracts or of foreign currencies.",
        "Are margin loans a better means of attaining leverage than LEAPS? I am using the Lifecycle Investing strategy proposed by Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres in their book of the same name which states that one should use 2:1 leverage for the first few years of their career as a long term investment strategy. The way they suggest doing this is by buying index funds like SPY with margin loans and LEAPS among other means. I am currently trying to determine which of the first two is the better option by calculating which of those two would require the lowest stock price change to break even. Lets say I had $10000 and I put it in SPY with no leverage. Since SPY has a 30day yield of 1.42 we may assume that the dividend returns would be 1.42% over then next year so the stock price could fall by 1001001/1.0142=1.4% 1.4% change and you would still break even because of the dividend. Since I use robinhood pls dont hate if I want to use 2:1 leverage through margin loans I can borrow $10000 to buy SPY on top of the $10000 I own with my money. The margin interest rate is 5% right now which is calculated by adding 2.5% to the target federal funds rate which will also go up to decrease inflation. Assuming it stays the same however the price change for SPY to reach breakeven with margin loans would be 52x1.42/2=1.08%. I pretty much took the interest rate subtracted from it the 30day yield times 2 because now we get twice as many dividends because we have twice as many shares and then divided that result by 2 because we also get double the gains for the same change in price. Furthermore we can also attain 2:1 leverage by buying a $205 9/23 SPY Call. SPY is currently priced at $413 and that calls ask price is $214 meaning that SPYs breakeven price change in this case would be 205214/4131100=1.45%. Since you miss out on dividends with calls we dont need to consider them here. According to my methodology and please correct  me if it is wrong margin loans appear to be the superior option especially for someone like me who is young and has a smaller account. The margin interest rate would need to go up by another .74% for the margin loan approach to have the same breakeven point as the LEAP approach. You might say thats likely to happen given more future rate hikes by the federal reserve. But even then each one of those calls costs $21400 and thus this approach requires at least that much money if not way more to successfully implement. Finally as prices fluctuate your leverage will too. If I used the margin loan approach mentioned earlier and SPY fell by 25% I would end up with $15000 worth of SPY shares. Since I have $10000 in loans of that $15000 only $5000 would be mine and therefore I would have 3:1 leverage. I would thus need to rebalance by selling stock to pay off my loans as the price goes down and take out loans to buy more stock as the price goes up to retain 2:1 leverage. The LEAP approach also requires rebalancing but since each LEAP is $20K you would actually need a lot more money than that to rebalance. Are there any factors that I have overlooked or is the margin approach simply better?",
        "If you buy shares of SPY you will be investing in the SPY. A prominent investor once challenged a host of mutual funds and hedge funds to a game. He said paraphrasing if any investing group is able to beat the SPY or some other broad market index that had a very low beta to SPY he would give them a massive chunk of cash. None could. Just use an online trade platform to nearly freely invest your money in a broad market index and beat almost everyone you discuss stocks with. It is very rare for anyone to beat the market over a couple of years or more if you dont just chiefly invest in broad market indexes.",
        "Timing the market vs. Rebalancing I know the concept of timing the market is overall a bad idea but isnt there a difference between timing the market and rebalancing a portfolio because you think something is going to happen in the market in the near future? Or is that the exact definition of timing the market? For example: I personally believe we arent in the clear just yet. I believe over the next couple months we will come down a little bit 3800 Samp;P to put a number on it. ALSO at some point i would like to get my account to at least 70% index im personally in SPY at about 50% right now the rest in various growth stocks  your big techs. If im projecting the market and specifically those growth stocks to come down in the near future would it be wise to just sell out and then DCA into SPY over the next few months to get to my 70%? Or would you guys consider that timing the market? Just for further information: This is money that i dont need now or really ever. I could honestly lose every penny in this account and my life wouldnt change. I am forever learning and this is another educational period where i can further myself as an investor.",
        "Thoughts on SPY cash and VOO margin So Ive been toying around with idea for a while and Im curious if it has been tried and what general thoughts are on this approach. I would use $700 from a paycheck this a comfortable amount and use it to by $700 of SPY shares on my interactive brokers account. At the same time and in addition I would buy $300 of VOO. My thoughts are to keep them separate so that when I sell to close the margin it will be clear and mentally I can track it this way. I do not have IBKR pro and I could switch to that for a lower rate. But if this were to be held for 10 years lets say and if borrowing rates stay below 8% then theoretically i could collect the spread. And with that would it be better to reinvest VOO dividends or take the cash to decrease the margin amount. My understandings of the risk are a massive decrease in the SP 500 but I think my leverage is low enough and rates raise too high and all benefits are negated. Should I consider this more or is this the start of a poor decision?",

        "The common stock market sayings and what they actually mean Stock market is insanely complex and sometimes to make sense of it we use quotes/sayings/adages  the issue that I have with them is that theyre often misused and other times dont make sense to begin with. Ill write some that tick me off the most and would love to see if there are any other contributions amp;x200B; Dont time the market  or some such variation of it. One of the most common sayings and has a lot of truth to it however often misused in a way that you can never know anything. Thats not true. The quote is a lesson for chartists/technical traders If you have a bullish outlook on the sp500 you shouldnt trade it on the daily basis and try to time every dip and peak  thats not a good strategy buy and hold. However REFUSING TO BUY SP500 WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH VALUATIONS IS NOT timing the market. And yet I see this so much someone will mention that they dont want to buy SPY yet and want to wait longer only to get bombarded with replies dont time the market. Relationship between the price you pay and your expected returns has nothing to do with market timing sometimes its just common sense Past performance is not indicative of future results  of course it is. Things are not totally random at the end of the day irrationality is mostly temporary. If you have a company with sky high valuations that are nonsensical while I wouldnt recommend shorting it which would be timing the market  its sky high valuations very much do indicate that the price is highly likely to down. Same applies to whole markets/indexes. A decade of lackluster equity returns is very likely to very succeeded by a decade of high equity returns and vice versa Stock market is not the economy  what is it then? The economy is made up of the same companies that make up the stock market. I think this one arises by the fact that people dont always grasp how pricing works. When you see economic data its backwards looking market prices future outlook. If the interest rate rises or the gdp data comes out negative it does not mean the market will fall down it will fall down if it comes out worse than expected. Similarly you can see rallies during harsh economic times because the data came out better than expected Its not a loss until you sell  This is an actively harmful saying that should be very discouraged. Sure it makes sense in terms of taxes but it doesnt make sure in the stock market. I see it so many times posts like I invested into X shit company I dont know what to do. Please help with top replies being some combination of Its not a loss until you sell You already lost so much might as well wait and sell covered calls. If you dont have no plan and its a shit company cut your losses.  Sunken cost fallacy is a bitch. Dont sell your index funds but if you bought into an EV startup a mistake I admit ive done as well in 2020 getting out while you still can is not a terrible idea even it means realizing your losses although theyre just as real when theyre M2M",

I think we are still early and have plenty of downside left. The Fed has no choice but to continue on their path and as a result markets will come down. People keep referring to the Fed pivot/put like in 2018 but the difference is is that there wasnt 8.5% inflation then. The Fed HAS to stop that or they are doomed.

The reason for the period of negative ROI for the investor who started at the peak of the market is because of the nature of DCA where earlier investments have a more significant impact on the overall average compared to later additions. Investors who felt the most pain were the ones who had invested substantial amounts of money during the bull runs leading up to the crashes.  if you started investing near the peak of the market DCA is a powerful tool to quickly get back to a positive ROI for the market. The stock market peaked in 10/2007 and didnt reach that price again until 04/2013. If you had DCAd your way through the crash if you started investing at the top you would be sitting at a ROI of 43% with an equivalent cost basis of the market price from mid 2003.  if youre fearing the market may not reach its 2021 highs for years its still in your best interest to keep averaging in to the market in the meantime.",

        "Why SPY is headed lower and CPIs downward trajectory is at risk Summary:  Year to Date SPY is down 24% but we still have room to go lower.  Thanks to energy prices there is a possibility that inflation has not peaked yet. Samp;P 500:  P/E and EPS Estimates  As shown on the above picture while the Samp;Ps P/E ratios have fallen to somewhat normalish levels it remains elevated when compared to the last 15 years. The P/E multiple is a function of growth expectations and discount rates. With growth likely headed lower and rates higher it is very likely the multiple will continue to see pressure in the near term.  However another big issue is the earnings portion of P/E. As you can see analyst EPS estimates are still too high. Even if the P/E multiple remains where it is lowered EPS estimates will be a big blow to the Samp;P and will take the index lower.  These EPS fears are further magnified by margins Margins are at notable highs and are all but confirmed to drive lower on a combination of higher inventory consumer resistance to price hikes and rising wages. CPI:   Chart 1 and Chart 2  In the above charts you can clearly see how CPI/PPI has performed in relation to the price of crude oil and gasoline. To put it short falling energy prices drives inflation lower and rising energy prices do the opposite.  Energy remains in an extremely tight situation and the relief from the SPR releases is beginning to wear off. This is all compounded by OPEC cuts EU energy tightness and further shenanigans from Russia. Note that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sees higher gas prices this winter as the EU cuts back on buying Russian oil and winter forces higher heating usage.  Just like lower energy prices flowed through all parts of the economy pushing back against inflation if energy prices rise it will have the opposite effect potentially pushing things back higher. Conclusion:  While many on social media would have you believe things are great and the bottom is near we have yet to discover how much pain the Fed is willing tolerate. This doesnt even include the impact of QT removal of cheap Russian energy and the potential for the Chinese growth engine to stall as their property markets implode.

        "JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF  10% yield...seems too good to be true. JEPI has a 10% yield . This is 24% better than junk bonds 7% better than TLT/IEF 6% better than LQD yet the chart is much smoother less downside. Seems almost too good to be true. gt;JEPI is an activelymanaged fund which seeks to generate income by investing in US stocks which have low volatility and which appear undervalued and through investments in equitylinked notes which provide the economic exposure of the US stock market and written sold call options. The fund is appropriate for investors seeking longterm income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally the options exposure of the equitylinked notes provides income but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market and exposes investors to counterparty risk. JEPI may be taxinefficient as distributions from the fund may be taxed as income and dividends from underlying stock holdings are not considered qualified because of the offsetting options positions.

Theres obviously nothing stopping the market overreacting and it going a lot further down but I thought hey 330 to begin to enter is a decent mental marker.

        "Stumped on my 8th stock to pick in my portfolios. Title says all but truthfully dont know who to ask so this place seems like a good place to throw some ideas around.  My current portfolio is currently and only concentrated in 7 stocks theres a fair bit of diversity in it but its mainly weighted on tech.  Ill give a list for what I got and my reasoning for each beyond the obvious that tech seems here to stay for many years which is my goal for these accounts retirement.  1.  AMD  Makes excellent processors seems to be if not already beating Intel in market share and technology due to their head start with their newer CPUs.   2.  MSFT  I dont think this needs elaboration. 3.  RTX  Government defense contracts are a big reason but they also own United Technologies now which is a big manufacturer for HVAC components among other things and in the future I see HVAC use trending upwards if nothing else climate change will make things way hotter.   4.  TFC  Truist Financial This is my bank is is actually a regional bank.  But they are also the 10th largest bank in the US with assets $509 Billion.  Stock is just solid.   5.  TSM  They contract with both Intel and AMD for their processors.  So if nothing else if Intel and AMD should fail either move the losses to TSM or just get out of tech in general.  China poses a potential issue but I see this is a nonissue due to the rest of the worlds reliance on Taiwan for their semiconductor production.   6.  VZ  Telecommunications company I picked it over ATamp;T because it has far less debt.  This is the dividend stock of the group.   7.  WMG  Warner Music Group I would have rather picked UMG but theyre not public.  Music royalties mainly  they have quite a few artist I like in their catalog.  Now a preface:  should this be taken as due diligence for anyone?  No not really these are just MY personal picks and Im just trying to even it out because I dont like odd numbers.  All of these companies could fail in the future and Id sell at a loss and put it into SPY like the rest of us.  But one of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was invest in things you understand and all of these are industries Ive either worked in or am very familiar with.  Im not investing expert.  That said I want my next pick to be something a bit more old money conservative so Ive been considering some more unorthodox options  like SPGI or CME.

        "Trade individual stocks to index/mutual funds or let them bounce back up? I have many individual stocks that I bought in 2020 and 2021 and thought it was a good idea since the market grew by a lot in 2021 as you all know.I admit I thought that individual stocks were more enticing than index/mutual funds because individual stock grew a lot more than index/mutual funds. But since then I learned more about index/mutual funds and how I can minimize my risk that way. Since stock market is down now I thought about selling my loss and buying index/mutual funds like SP500 with a thinking that those index/mutual funds will have more chance to grow faster than the individual stocks. I understand that I will sell for loss and there is still risk involved even when buying index/mutual funds. What do you think of this thought process? Should I trade my individual stocks for index/mutual funds? Or should I keep the individual stocks and wait for them to bounce back?

        "How to balance long term leveraged/unleveraged ETFs According to all of the hard research Ive seen for young investors with a long term time commitment 2x leverage is actually right around the peak sweet spot for compounding returns.  Ive been thinking about how to utilize this strategy even further. Right now I just dump everything into $SSO as I have for a few years now. Does anyone have any idea on some surefire lol I know nothing is surefire strategies to mitigate the damage done during crashes? which are the most vulnerable periods for a 2x leveraged ETF account Ive been thinking about investing 70% into $SSO the remaining 30% into $SPY and then whenever a real crash occurs 30% or more market dump take the $SPY and dump it into $SSO at the bottom rinse and repeat. This effectively deleverages my account from 2x to like 1.75x I believe but more importantly allows me to dollar cost average into the $SSO troughs which are going to be quite deep during bad crashes.

I get the increased risk with volitlity of a strong dollar to  exchange rate and that there is increased risk with simply backing a one country market but do the increased returns albiet from a  limited historial dataset not outway these risks?

Was going to sell some of them before end of 2022 to offset some other gains for tax loss harvesting. Which would normally have been fine but...I accidentally forgot about that and bought 10 shares of SPY this past Thursday 12/22/2022 when it dipped down to $375 momentarily. Now because of that purchase there isnt enough time left in the year to wait out the required 31 days to tax loss harvest the more expensive shares before the year ends without triggering a wash sale. But...unless...what if I sell the 10 shares I bought Thursday for a small gain first assuming the market price holds up on Monday morning. Will that then enable me to sell some of the more expensive shares and still be able to do a tax loss harvest for 2022 on them without triggering the wash sale?

        "A Random Walk and Technical Analysis I am learning about technical analysis and have historically been a buy/hold investor with the understanding that you cant time the market because its random the market is efficient and is always priced with all available public information. I am now learning technical analysis and I am trying to wrap my head around it. Technical analysis is used to predict the next move based on past buy/sell transactions. There is a lot of free technical info available such as with Tradingview.com A friend of mine trades in and out of SPY using only the MACD. It seems simple enough buy when the indicator hits buy and sell when the indicator moves to sell. Is it that simple? If the tools and information are publicly available isnt it priced at the current price? And if its this simple why isnt everyone doing the same? Isnt the market random?",
        "Comparing ETFs performances is not simple. Is there a platform to do that? Most of my ETF performance comparison happens on Google Finance which has a pretty simple interface and is free but has severe shortcomings. Namely it only follows the stock price without taking any other consideration. So Id like something better typically with these features:  Choice to include dividends in the time curve. Aka: how much my money would grow if I reinvested the dividends?. Depending on the time frame VOO may outperform SCHD or otherwise they are comparable but the former has a dividend yield of 1.7% and the latter of about 3.4% which is significant over the long run.  Accounts for TER. If you compare SPY vs VOO you see a mere 0.01% difference over 5 years. But SPY TER is 0.09% and VOO TER is 0.03%. So the actual difference is higher than what appears by simply following the stock price.  Accounts for creation date. If you set the time window to MAX on SPY vs VOO on Google Finance you see that the comparison is completely useless. Google even tells you that SPY outperforms VOO 766% to 244%. A good comparison should index ETFs together depending on their creation date. Or allow a more flexible choice of time axis.  Accounts for currency. If you compare IWDA traded in EUR vs traded in USD you observe a significant difference. But its the exact same ETF the difference only comes from currency exchange and the devaluation of EUR against USD. Same if you compare a Samp;P500 ETF in CHF against VOO Basically all these features are needed to answer the very basic question: if I invest 1000 of my home currency in two given ETFs which one would give me the best return?  Is there a web platform to do that? If not is there an open API where I could easily extract that information?",

I just switched to this portfolio after losing about 70% of my account value in the last 8 months from holding ROKU PYPL PENN and DIS. I finally realized the losses in those this past week and switched to the above setup. But now my acct value is like 1/3 of what it was this past October. Any suggestions to get me back to where I was in October? Open to hear any ideas. Should I stay in the ETFs above that Im in now to try and recover my account value? Or maybe wait the 30days from selling those ones I was so far down on and buy them again to try and ride those back up? Not sure what the best method would be to try and get my account value back to where it was. I do typically sell covered calls on my holdings. And Im using about 40% margin too. Selling the covered calls covers the margin interest Im paying but I want to use the margin to hold more stock than I otherwise would be able to. I used it on the way down so Im thinking I probably need to try and use it on the way back up also or itll take forever to recover the money I lost. EDIT: So today after reading all the replies I closed my sold covered calls positions and I sold enough stock to get me out of margin. I right now only have VTI. Thats what my last 30% of my account value is in now. I need to think more about what to do going forward to give me the best gains from here. Adding cash to my account is not an option right now. The only buy more while its low I can do is to buy more using margin. Im in my mid50s and live off a small pension that barely covers my monthly expenses.

This is 24% better than junk bonds 7% better than TLT/IEF 6% better than LQD yet the chart is much smoother less downside. Seems almost too good to be true. gt;JEPI is an activelymanaged fund which seeks to generate income by investing in US stocks which have low volatility and which appear undervalued and through investments in equitylinked notes which provide the economic exposure of the US stock market and written sold call options. The fund is appropriate for investors seeking longterm income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally the options exposure of the equitylinked notes provides income but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market and exposes investors to counterparty risk. JEPI may be taxinefficient as distributions from the fund may be taxed as income and dividends from underlying stock holdings are not considered qualified because of the offsetting options positions. Source: wealthfronnt Since early 2021 it completely crushes AGG and has a better Sharpe than even SPY :  This is probably the best ETF I have seen in a long time.

Im starting with $90000 and my allocations are currently: 55% FXAIX 15% FSKAX 10% FNCMX 10% FSPSX 10% VNQ My question is am I too over/under invested in one market? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",
        "New to the investing game. Are REIT ETFs a good option nowadays? Mainly thinking about how underused a lot of office buildings are due to remote work now. It puts me off pulling the trigger on REIT ETFs like BDN and VNQ. Most of my portfolio is high div / low expense ratio ETFs like SPYD and VTI. Should I double down there or look at REITs?",
        "REIT  Save alternative to bonds? Suppose you are retiring in 1520 years so you keep roughly 30% of your portfolio in bonds. Basically your portfolio has a 70% risky portion and a 30% safety portion. Suppose you take your safety portion and put a third of it in REITs such as VNQ. So it leaves you with 20% bonds 10% REIT.  Are you less safe?",
        "Funds that mirror TIAAs QREARX real estate account? Are there any nonTIAA funds that mirror the approach of QREARX? Since this is more of a private equity / management company the well know REITs like VNQ behave nothing like it and I cant find a good alternative. Any thoughts would be appreciated",
        "Invest in a single Broad Index ETF vs Multiple Sector EFTs? I am setting up a weekly recurring investment in ETrade which allows for partial ETF buys with automation. I am considering just a single lump buy of VOO or VTI vs breaking the purchase up into equally smaller buys into a spread like this. VGT VNQ XLF VPU VDC XLE VHT BND SCHD ARKK. I am aware the VOO/VTI vs sector ETFs are not equivalent but are there any benefits to being more specific in what I buy rather than just doing VOO/VTI? I like the idea of being able to tailor and customize percentages specifically into a sector as market conditions change and also seeing performance by sector over time."

I have another $40k in ibonds earmarked for postclose items furnishing repair/reno etc and another $80k earmarked for the same purpose that had been sitting in Betterment until I recently moved it to Schwab.  The 80k is all bond ETFs.  Market performance this year has made me realize Im very riskaverse with this 80k.  While I check my regular taxable account quarterly I find myself checking Schwab a few times per week.  Granted bond performance has been historically bad but Im wasting time and energy worrying about it. I know I wont need this money to secure a house.  I know I wont need to draw down the full amount all at once.  But beyond that I dont know when Ill need it.  Could be 3 months 6 months 9 monthsIm really hoping its not 1824 months. What should I do with this allocation?  Move the entire thing to HYSA and take the 1.9%? T bill ladder? Ultrashort bond ETF?

        "Best Treasury bond ETF to buy right before the Fed slashes rates from 4.5% to 0%? Why isnt TLT performance inverted vs SHY this year? Help me reconcile the seemingly contradictory price action between the US Treasury yield curve and treasury ETFs this year.  The hypothetical scenario is in the title. On the surface I thought SHY 13 yr bonds average maturity 1.9 yrs would be a good idea for my scenario since they inhabit the portion of the yield curve affected the most by the Feds activities while being the soonest to mature.  However despite the spiking of rates this year they are only 4.4% YTD vs TLT 20yr bonds being down 25.7% .  I can memorize the fact longer duration is more sensitive to interest rates so ZROZ is best but I dont understand why.  Im missing something.  Explain this to me as if I wear a mask in my car by myself.",
        "SGOV vs SHV vs SHY yields/prices I bought SGOV 03 mo treasuries and notice that the per share price goes up from say 100.06 to 100.22 over the course of the month then they declare the dividend then the per share price goes down after the last day of the month. Presumably this is the maturity of the basket of the underlying tbills. No big deal about the pershare decrease because you get the interest payout about a week later. i.e. you arent really losing because you have the $0.15 cash back in your account. But what about something like SHV or SHY? Do these also essentially do the same thing? Are the dividends also paid out on a semiregular schedule coinciding with the maturities of the underlying tbills? SHVs chart less than 12 months looks like maybe it has this pattern. But SHYs chart does not?? Asking because if the 13 year treasuries are yielding better than the 03 month treasuries why not just buy the SHY ETF so I have some liquidity say 6 months from now? Is SHY not exactly like the underlying treasury because the underlying note thats paying 4% isnt going to be distributing that interest until 20242025? So whats getting distributed today are the interests on the ones bought 13 years ago and I presume at a much lower rate? So to mimic buying the 13 year treasuries directly youd really have to be holding SHY for 13 years as well?",
        "Treasury ETFs vs. Treasury Bonds I have about 50k that I would like to invest in bonds that return 4.5% at close to no risk for the next 12 years. Seems like getting Treasury Bonds is one route but I would ideally not want to open another account deal with separate tax forms etc.. Will an ETF like SHY give me similar yield and tax benefits i.e. no statelocal taxes ? Are there any other risks with the ETF?  If you have any resources that explain how Treasury ETFs actually work that would be great as well. amp;x200B; Thanks",
        "Looking for a treasurybased fund that doesnt pay dividends frequently For income management reasons Id like to avoid a fund that pays out each month once or twice a year is OK. I want the security of treasuries but I also want liquidity. So something like a SCHB which is low dividend payout but investing in treasuries instead. So when I choose to sell thats when I would be recognizing income. Does something like this exist? I know of SHY but it looks like it pays out monthly. Or can this be achieved by buying a 1 or 2 year treasury and selling it in the secondary market if I later need the liquidity?  But then rate risk comes into play and Im not sure what that looks like i.e.  when rates go up the market price of a 2year I would have bought goes down.  But is there nothing to be gained for having held it for say 9 months?"

        "The best stocks or sector ETFs to own during rising rates? Tldr; I just want to know your top ETFs stocks you have bought for the rising rate environment and why? Below is my just my current reasoning as well as some of my favorite   Ive recently rebalanced my 401k to be pretty diversified into ETFs and am looking to increase my exposure in my retail account to single stocks Ive bought plenty of tech stocks over the last few years and sold them off during the fall of 2021. Im very bullish on tech but I dont want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their moms have a different feeling on where the economy is heading but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info and that as of right now is that rates will go up probably beyond 3% and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with Chinas economy Covid/MP Supply chains Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.   So my question is what stocks individual or sector based ETFs do you believe will perform within the next 23 years as rates rise to 3%?   Ive done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow   My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy for now is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks most notably BAC.   My third pick would be a suite of DSF Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher inflation they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years the P/Es are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.   My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin Raytheon and Boeing.    To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV Tracks price of silver and GDX Gold Miners ETF along with UNH stock which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.   My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials 15% Defense/Aero 20% Precious Metals 10% Healthcare UNH   10% In Wells Fargo 10% XLF 20% Financials 5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials  Consumer Credit 5% Silvergate Capital this carries the highest risk in my opinion but Im bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.   5% BA 5% Raytheon 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace   10% SLV 10% GDX  20%  Precious Metals/Commodities   10% UNH stock  Healthcare   After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months Ive found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market technology would be going up or down but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks inflation and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldnt find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97 a share after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening and I dont want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear I want to make decisions based off a trajectory thats most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses as well as adding defensive stock like LHM RTX and Boeing which I think will have always been great names but now was the time to add to them for exposure.    I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me so a small update and where Im invested now.   20% BRKB  10% QQQ  10% VTI  10% VIG  10% HYG  20% GDX  20% ICLN   I do enjoy holding individual stocks but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio after maxing out to 20500/year and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETFs I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing Im financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.   I dont expect people to read this far but if you do what are your top stocks/ETF sector specific for the next 2 years and why?",
        "Opportunity in junk bond etfs Im retired and depend on my 401k for a portion of my income stream. Ive been looking at $JNK and $HYG    The returns over 5 10 and lifetime of the funds do not look that great 3% to 4%. So I calculated a simplified  total return assuming no reinvestment  for a share purchase at the 2009 trough.  The total return came out to about 8%. I also see that their share price is  currently in a trough.  I fully understand that past performance is no indication of future performance but is it fair to say the current pricing presents a potential opportunity to realize appreciable yields. Am I looking at this correctly?  Your insights are appreciated. Edit: this move would represent about 5% to 10% of my portfolio.  Im currently about 20% stocks  20% cash and 60% bonds.    Ive taken some profits from the 2021 runup and have that in cash as well as bonds.  I generally buy and hold bonds to maturity.  Im looking to start investing again."

        "Fixed duration bond ETFs long run returns and volatility in an era of consistently rising rates like the 1970s Bond ETFs that hold only a specific duration are a very popular investment vehicle nowdays for portfolio construction. For example $IEF holds US treasury bonds with expiration between 7 and 10 years.  With yields going from 0.5% to 3.2% in the span of two years these types of funds specifically long duration ones have taken a massive hit: for example $IEF is down almost 20% which one could argue is pretty volatile for a bond funds that invests in riskfree assets. If we were to see a long period of consistently rising rates something that we havent seen in 40 years like the 1960s and 1970s where yields went from 3.5% all the way to more than 15% I do wonder what would be the long term performance of the funds and their volatility during this period untile rates start going back down again. We have really nothing to compare this or backtest since bonds were much different back then they were callable. For example In a scenario where the US10Y goes to 15% I know its probably highly unlikely does $IEF really fall another 70% from where it is today before going back up? Does it not? How is the long term CAGR affected? What is the volatility? Because I assume that if these funds just keep rolling over their bonds to keep the maturity fixed they are just going to take loss after loss. They are not holding bonds until maturity. Are these funds going to run out of fashion and utility if people realize they are money losers in a rising interest rate enviroment?",
        "JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF  10% yield...seems too good to be true. JEPI has a 10% yield . This is 24% better than junk bonds 7% better than TLT/IEF 6% better than LQD yet the chart is much smoother less downside. Seems almost too good to be true. gt;JEPI is an activelymanaged fund which seeks to generate income by investing in US stocks which have low volatility and which appear undervalued and through investments in equitylinked notes which provide the economic exposure of the US stock market and written sold call options. The fund is appropriate for investors seeking longterm income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally the options exposure of the equitylinked notes provides income but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market and exposes investors to counterparty risk. JEPI may be taxinefficient as distributions from the fund may be taxed as income and dividends from underlying stock holdings are not considered qualified because of the offsetting options positions. Source: wealthfronnt Since early 2021 it completely crushes AGG and has a better Sharpe than even SPY :  This is probably the best ETF I have seen in a long time. It has superior income to fixedincome but without interest rate risk."

        "DocuSign Earnings Spook Investors Consumer Prices Unexpectedly Rise; Stocks Fall as Lows Outpace Highs During trading Friday 1 stock traded to a 52week high while 154 stocks bottomed out at new 52week lows. The Samp;P 500 is down 2.29% so far today while the Dow is down 2.06% the Nasdaq is down 2.94% and the Russell 2000 is down 2.88%. Stocks are lower this afternoon following an unexpected uptick in consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index rose 1.0% in May against estimates set at a 0.7% rise. This brought the yearly rise to a 40year high. The report challenged the peak inflation narrative as prices rose in nearly every category and mean that the Fed is forced to maintain its aggressive ratehike path to tackle inflation. Meanwhile the preliminary reading for the University of Michigans Index of Consumer Sentiment eroded more than expected in June to a reading of 50.2 compared to estimates for a rise to a reading of 59.0. This is the lowest reading ever for the index dating back to 1978 as Consumer Expectations fall amidst persistent inflation. Docusign Inc DOCU is declining 23.84% after the company missed earnings and reaffirmed fullyear 2023 revenue guidance while providing in line guidance for the second quarter. There were some notable and worrisome comments and actions in the earnings report. DocuSign slashed its fullyear billing guidance amidst many headwinds including inflationary and workforce woes. Further the war in Ukraine is dampening its demand in Europe one of DocuSigns largest markets for expansion. Lastly the company doubled its size during the pandemic and has struggled to find a way to maintain growth with the company noting that the strong COVID tailwind has turned into a headwind. Sector Highlights The Real Estate sector makes up the majority of our 52week lows as 33 out of our 154 lows come from the Real Estate sector. The Real Estate sector is outperforming the market today decreasing 1.68% so far on the day. Over the last month the Real Estate sector has underperformed the market decreasing 6.05% while the Samp;P decreased by 2.56%.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 20th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 20th 2022.  Look for more selling pressure next week as investors learn the hard way not to fight the Fed  Source  gt; Wall Street and the Federal Reserve appeared to enter a new reality this week and the result for investors was big losses with no obvious end point in sight.  gt; The Samp;P 500 is on its way to its 10th down week in the last 11 and is now well into a bear market. On Thursday all 11 of its sectors closed more than 10% below their recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 30000 for the first time since January 2021.  gt; Unlike recent drawdowns for stocks however the central bank will not be putting a bottom in the market. Instead the Fed raised interest rates by threequarters of a percentage point on Wednesday  its biggest since 1994  and signaled continued tightening ahead. Powell will testify before Congress next week and is expected to hold firm on his plan for a more aggressive Fed until inflation is brought to heel.  gt; Bank of America equity strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note to clients on Friday that it is time for investors to stop fighting the Fed and give up the buythedip mentality.  gt; In a bear market heroism is punished. Valor is unnecessary and cowardice is called for in portfolio construction  that is the way to preserve capital and live to fight another day waiting for the next central bank panic and better valuations and a new earnings upcycle Kapur wrote.  gt; Tech stocks which are sensitive to interest rates have been hit particularly hard as have cyclical plays such as airlines and cruise lines.  gt; But the dramatic declines have not been limited to stocks. B/itcoin dropped more than 30% in a week amid reports about blowups of c/ryptofocused trading firms. Treasury yields which move opposite of bond prices have spiked.  gt; Markets briefly rallied on Wednesday afternoon after the Feds announcement but that optimism was quickly dashed and the gains reversed on Thursday. Many strategists are warning that markets and sentiment could have further to fall pointing to Wall Street earnings estimates that curiously still show solid growth in the coming year.  gt; These people need to fight inflation as fast as possible and as hard as possible. And the market has consistently been behind the curve on trying to understand how aggressive this Fed was going to be said Andrew Smith chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors.  gt;  Recession ahead? gt; The impact of the Feds rate hikes on the market has been magnified by deteriorating economic data as investors and strategists appear to be losing confidence in the central banks ability to achieve a soft landing.  gt; The housing market appears to be cooling rapidly with housing starts and mortgage applications plummeting. Consumer sentiment is plumbing record lows. Jobless claims are beginning to trend higher as reports of layoffs at tech firms grow. And all oil prices show no signs of falling back below $100 per barrel as the summer travel season kicks off.  gt; In a note to clients on Friday Bank of America global economist Ethan Harris described the U.S. economy as one revision away from recession.  gt; Our worst fears around the Fed have been confirmed: they fell way behind the curve and are now playing a dangerous game of catch up. We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero inflation to settle at around 3% and the Fed to hike rates above 4% Harris wrote.  gt; Even among more optimistic economists the outlook calls for a rather bumpy landing. JPMorgans Michael Feroli said in a note Friday that he expected Powell to be largely successful in balancing fighting inflation with economic growth but a recession is a distinct possibility.  gt; This desired soft landing is not guaranteed and Fed chair Powell himself has noted that achieving this goal may not be entirely straightforward. And with a tight labor market and the economy dealing with the shocks of tighter financial conditions and higher food and energy prices recession risks are notable as we think about the next few years Feroli wrote. Our models point to 63% chance of recession over the next two years and 81% odds that a recession starts over the next three.  gt;  Coming up gt; Powell will be in the hot seat again next week as he returns to Capitol Hill to testify before both houses of Congress and he is unlikely to soften his stance over the weekend.  gt; The Fed Chair said on Wednesday that he and his committee members were absolutely determined to keep inflation expectations from rising. The central bank said in a report to Congress on Friday ahead of the hearings that its commitment to price stability is unconditional.  gt; Inflation has risen to a top political issue as well as an economic one and the Feds raised forecast for unemployment could also come under scrutiny from lawmakers.  gt; As theyre going to 2.5% 3.5% Fed funds rate if the economy is slowing toward a recession I dont think theyre going to stand on the throat of the economy to get inflation to go down said Robert Tipp chief investment strategist for PGIM Fixed Income. ...Otherwise in order to get inflation down from 3.5% to 2% youre going to have to lose your job. Thats going to be the message: Were going to have to get some job losses and recession. And I dont think that tradeoff is going to be worth it for them.  gt; On Friday investors will get an updated consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan. That measure has now taken on increased significance after Powell pointed to it this week as one of the reasons the Fed decided to raise its rate hike this month.  gt; The surveys preliminary reading for June showed a record low for sentiment and confirmation of that number  or even further deterioration  would likely serve as further proof that the Fed will not waver in the coming months. The inflation expectations part of the survey which rose in the preliminary reading will be watched closely.  gt; Outside of those events next week is relatively light for economic events with U.S. stock markets closed on Monday for Juneteenth. Investors will be looking for insight into the U.S. economy in earnings reports from a few bellwether stocks such as Lennar on Tuesday and FedEx on Thursday.

On Monday the Samp;P 500 Index moved into a bear market finally closing 20% beneath the January 3 high. gt; Here are 7 things to know about bear and bull markets: gt;  Since World War II seven bull markets have officially doubled. The recent bull market was the fastest to ever double but it also ended much quicker than the others at less than two years old. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 2 The bull market that just ended lasted only 21 months from the March 2020 lows until the January 2022 peak checking in as the shortest bull market since WWII. As noted above though it was also the quickest to ever double. Wow. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 3 Here are all the bear and near bear markets since 1950. This bear market is actually already old by recent standards explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. At more than five months old it is already older than six other bear markets going back nearly 40 years. Only the tech bubble and Great Financial Crisis bears lasted longer. gt; This could mean the bear market could be closer to a bottom than many expect. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 4 What could happen next? As we show in the LPL Research Chart of the Day the good news is a year after the Samp;P 500 moves into a bear stocks actually do pretty well up an average of nearly 15% a year later with a very solid median gain of 23.8%. gt; The catch and theres always a catch the returns a year later were negative in the 197374 recession the tech bubble and the Financial Crisis 20082009. The good news is we dont see an economy like that over the next year so the likelihood of higher prices maybe significantly higher is quite strong in our view. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 5 How quickly could stocks bottom once a bear starts? The data is all over the map here. It took only 11 days in March 2020 for the lows to form while it took 18 months after the tech bubble. Bottom line we think this could play out more like things did in 1987 or the 1950s and 1960s with the ultimate low taking place sooner rather than later. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 6 Looking at previous bears that took place without a recession still our base case showed that stocks tend to bottom at a little more than down 20%. Yes 1987 is in there but most of the other times stocks bottomed near where we are now suggesting potentially limited pain from current levels. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; 7 Investors need to remember that since the Samp;P 500 Index moved to 500 stocks on March 4 1957 it has made 1184 new alltime highs and it has always eventually achieved new highs even if it doesnt feel that way today. Wars skyhigh inflation recessions bubbles 100 year pandemics geopolitical events policy mistakes and more have all happened over this time but stocks have always come back eventually to new highs. We do not think this time will be any different. As long as businesses can grow earnings over the long run the fundamentals are in place for future stock gains which means new highs could be coming as well. gt; They say the stock market is the only place things go on sale and people run out of the store screaming. Please remember that before you make any rash investment decisions. gt; Lastly the Samp;P 500 was just down more than 1% for four consecutive days. This very rare occurrence hasnt been fun for investors but be aware the returns after these painful streaks have been very strong higher a year later 9 out of 9 times with a solid 26.7% gain on average. Additionally each consecutive day saw a larger loss than the previous during the four day streak. That has only happened two other times in history in March 2009 and December 2018. Those werent the worst times to be looking for opportunities. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Market Prone to Late June Weakness gt; June is not a great month for the market in general. Its even weaker in midterm years. But the week after June Triple Witching is horrendous. Down Triple Witching Weeks also tend to trigger more weakness the week after. gt; But with Samp;P 500 down 10 of the last 11 weeks and down 11.3% to date which would be the second worst June ever behind 1930 perhaps some of the usual endofQ2 carnage has been pulled forward. gt; Any perceived improvement inflation Russia/Ukraine war or supply chains would be welcomed by the market. With the bear on the loose caution and patience remain the best course of action. Happy Fathers Day to all the dads Hit em Straight gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  History of bear markets points to an October 2022 bottom gt; On Monday of this week DJIA fell into an official Ned Davis Research NDR bear market. This raises the question Where can we go from here? In the table above we examine all the 13% DJIA declines after 145 days since 1948 and the subsequent action after. The four 30% Value Line Geometric reversal bear markets in 1987 1990 1998 and 2020 are included for reference. gt; Of the eighteen others only the two reached bottom at the 13% 145day decline 1953 and 2016. Eight were followed by further declines of less than 10% and eight greater. Twelve bottomed out less than three months later and six dragged on for 6 months or more. The average additional decline was 12.4% over an average of 139 calendar days. Based upon DJIAs close on June 13 and these averages DJIA could ultimately find bottom around October 31 2022 at 26732.13. This would represent a total bear market decline of 27.4% in 298 calendar days. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Sentiment Staying Low gt; More hawkish monetary policy and the Samp;P 500 hitting the bear market threshold have given sentiment plenty of reason to turn lower and thats exactly what has happened. After reaching a shortterm high of 32% only two weeks ago the percentage of respondents to the AAII survey considering themselves bullish has fallen back below 20% this week. That may not be as extreme of reading as those in the midteens from back in April but it is still a historically low reading and in the bottom 2% of all weeks going back to the start of the survey in 1987. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While bullish sentiment has declined this weeks 1.6 percentage point decline was actually much smaller than the 11 percentage point drop last week. An even bigger decline occurred for those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading fell 9.9 percentage points from a recent high of 32.1%. Now at 22.2% the percentage of neutral respondents is back down to the lowest level since the start of May. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; With both bullish and neutral sentiment falling the bearish camp picked up the difference. Heading into this week bearish sentiment was already elevated at 46.9%. The 11.4 percentage point bump this week means that well over half of respondents are now bearish with the current reading just 1.1 percentage points shy of the 59.4% high from the end of April. That ranks as the eleventh highest reading of all weeks on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; That also means the percentage of bears outweighs bulls by an astounding 38.9 percentage points and is the lowest reading since the last week of April. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Not only do bears outweigh bulls by a large margin but it has also been a historically long length of time that this has been the case. Smoothing out the reading by taking a fourweek moving average of the bullbear spread the average has been below 10 in other words on average over a fourweek span bearish sentiment has been at least 10 percentage points higher than bullish sentiment for 21 straight weeks. That surpassed another long 18week streak in 2020 and is now only five weeks short of the record stretch of 26 weeks in the early 1990s. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Not only has the AAII survey showed souring sentiment but so too have the weekly NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence surveys. This week the NAAIM index showed investment managers only have 32.2% long equity exposure. Meanwhile the Investors Intelligence survey saw the most negative bullbear spread in a month. Normalizing each of these three sentiment indicators the average reading is now 1.28 standard deviations from the historical norm. That is not as bad as last month but it remains a historically pessimistic reading on sentiment. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Asset Class Performance During QT gt; As mentioned in our piece from earlier today gold did not necessarily deliver superior performance during the last QT cycle. This leaves investors to ponder: which asset classes did deliver substantial returns? Is there anywhere to hide? Although the macroenvironment is vastly different this time around it is still helpful to look at past occurrences to attempt to put a frame of reference around todays markets. Major differences include rampant inflation particularly in commodities supply chain constraints lapping stimulus benefits and weakening economic data. Below we summarize the performance of the Samp;P 500 bonds agricultural commodities and oil during previous QT cycles. gt; The Samp;P 500 outperformed Gold during the last QT cycle gaining 19.2% which constitutes an annualized return of 10.1%. The graph below outlines the performance of the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY during different cycles of QE and QT. As you can see equities were not particularly steady during the last QT cycle but SPY gained significantly after the Fed announced its intent to slow the balance sheet winddown. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In the last QT cycle the bond market initially sold off but managed to finish higher for the entire period. The iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF AGG bottomed at a drawdown of 4.7% about a year after the cycle began but proceeded to gain 6.7% through the final 203 trading days of the cycle. When all was said and done AGG finished the cycle with gains of 1.7%. Similar to what we saw in gold much of the gains were seen after the Fed announced its plan to slow the winddown of the balance sheet. This suggests that rates rose at first but then reversed course when the Fed announced the impending end of QT. So far in the current cycle AGG has already dropped by 2.7% but bonds sold off hard in anticipation of QT in late 2021 and early 2022. On a YTD basis the ETF is down a whopping 12.7%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Agricultural commodities performed poorly during the last QT cycle dropping 15.7%. This constitutes an annualized return of 8.9% but the broader agricultural space was in a downtrend before QT began. Currently agricultural commodities are in an uptrend so it will be interesting to watch the price action as QT ramps up. On a YTD basis the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund DBA is up 10.2% and is essentially flat since QT began in early May. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; During the last QT cycle crude oil gained 15.8% but it would be difficult to attribute these gains to quantitative tightening. Since the Fed began tightening this year crude oil has jumped 16.0% higher. In the last cycle oil rallied higher before subsequently crashing which would certainly be welcomed by many in this cycle. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  DJIA is officially in a bear market gt; For years we have relied upon the Ned Davis Research definition of bear and bull markets. An official bear market requires a 30% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or a 13% decline after 145 calendar days. Reversals of 30% in the Value Line Geometric Index also qualify. The drop is measured from peak to trough and both price and time criteria must be met. At todays close it has been 160 calendar days since DJIAs peak on January 4 DJIA is down 17.1% and at a new closing low which meets the parameters. gt; Inflation is stubbornly remaining at multidecade highs the Fed is tightening sentiment is bearish support levels are not holding supply chain disruptions persist there is conflict in Europe and energy prices are at record highs for consumers. Continue to be patient as the Weak Spot of the fouryearcycle will eventually give way to the Sweet Spot likely sometime later in Q3 or in early Q4. Even with inflation at multidecade highs cash is likely the least dangerous place to wait.  gt;  Weak May Housing Data gt; Earlier this week we highlighted the fact that mortgage activity had fallen off a cliff due to a historic rise in rates. This is an important factor to keep in mind as the housing market tends to be a strong leading indicator for recessions as every recession besides the COVID crash since the early 1960s has been preceded by a pronounced decline in Housing Starts. Although the NAHB index has already rolled over substantially Housing Starts and Building Permits are yet to drop on a trailing twelvemonth basis. However the data has been showing signs of weakness as we have now seen two consecutive months of declines in permits and a significant monthovermonth fall in starts. gt; The table below breaks down this months report by type of unit and region and shows both the monthovermonth and yearoveryear changes. Contrary to what we saw last month Housing Starts moved higher in the Northeast and Midwest on a m/m basis while the South and West saw dramatic declines. On a y/y basis only the Northeast smallest of the four regions saw starts move higher. In aggregate Housing Starts fell by 14.4% month over month and 3.5% year over year. Although multiunits fell more than single units the decline was substantial for both. In terms of permits there was no positivity in sight as every region saw m/m declines. This is not a positive sign for future starts data as permits must be issued before starts can occur. In aggregate Building Permits fell by 7.0% month over month driven by a massive decline in the Northeast. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; For the first time since February of 2021 the 12month average of Housing Starts declined on a m/m basis. A rollover in this figure tends to be a strong recession indicator which based on prior history would suggest that the economy is not yet in a recession. If this data continues to weaken though. recession alarms will start ringing. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The charts below show the rolling 12month average for Housing Starts and Building Permits since 2010 on both an overall basis top chart and for singlefamily units specifically bottom chart. Overall the 12month average for headline starts and permits has experienced headwinds as of late with the rate of increase for both slowing down and starts actually showing a slight decline. The trend for singlefamily units however is much more divergent as permits have already started to roll over after peaking last summer while singlefamily starts have essentially leveled off during that same span. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies tickers reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 5th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 5th 2022.  Major stock averages slide for third week Nasdaq posts sixday losing streak  Source  gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.  gt; After rallying through the morning the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points or about 1.1% at 31318.44. The Samp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3924.26 its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11630.86 recording its first sixday losing streak since 2019.  gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and Samp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3% respectively while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.  gt; Theres still a lot of nervousness around what well see over the next few months said Callie Cox U.S. investment analyst at eToro. Yes inflation and the job market are coming back into balance but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.  gt; To make matters worse the Samp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone  below its three big moving averages she added. Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now they seem to be ceilings that the index just cant bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this selloff again we also may not reach new highs any time soon.  gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes arent going away anytime soon. Thats put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the Samp;P 500 fails to hold the 3900 level those summer lows could come back into play.  gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report which showed the economy added 315000 jobs for the month just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.  gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% twotenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because its one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75basispoint hike.  gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

DJIA Samp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA Samp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the markets performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. Samp;P 500 is weakest up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.  gt;  Bears Back Above 50% gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak the Samp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the backtoback declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiments eight percentage point weekoverweek increase was the largest since midJune and the third weekly increase in a row. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bullbear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Given the reversal in the spread the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  August Declines All Around the World gt; The end of August is here and US equities as measured by the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY have been on a wild ride. At the midmonth high SPY was sitting on a 4.3% monthtodate gain but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries on average they had reached a 3.13% gain at their monthtodate highs but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24% respectively. In fact there are only two ETFsBrazil EWZ and India INDAthat are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile China MCHI is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum Sweden EWD has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance. gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August most have moved back below their 50DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As we show in the table above this years declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below preCOVID highs as well. At the moment there are only four countries that remain above preCOVID 52week highs: Taiwan EWT India INDA the United States SPY and Canada EWC. This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs and as shown in the chart below each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before preCOVID highs become a technical level worth eying. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds gt; So far in 2022 stocks and bonds have both sold off leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen and partially because of this fact equities have had a tough year. The Samp;P 500 ETF SPY is down 16.0% on a YTD basis while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF AGG has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically rates fall alongside equities as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different though and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a twoweek trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in realtime. gt; Although the 200day correlation between stocks SPY and bonds AGG has been higher once before in late 2009 the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200day correlation sits at 0.87 which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over as illustrated by the chart below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The more we zoom in the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures such as the 100 and 50day correlation coefficients have already moved substantially off of their recent highs even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70 while the 50day coefficient is even lower at 0.55 the lowest levels since midJune and midMay respectively. This tells us that the 200day correlation will likely pull back further thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise and visaversa. As evidence of this today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction theyll each go gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The rolling 100day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 or 50% for 129 trading days which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining the 100day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Continuing Claims Catching Up gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On a nonseasonally adjusted NSA basis the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility assuming normal seasonal patterns NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year this weeks reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture initial claims not turning into continuing claims has completely turned around it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catchup. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Looking for opinions or recommendations on list of ETFs Hello I am getting together a list of ETFs that interest me. I do not have any assets as of now but I will be buying in a couple of months or so. I am trying to make a diversified portfolio comprised of things I believe will do will in the coming 30 years or so. If anyone has any recommendations about possible overlapping ETFs or recommendations about an ETF that could better cover multiple I am looking at.  Heres the list: BOTZ Covers AI associated with chips utilities and infrastructure. ROBO mainly focused on the automation side of AI. EVX waste management. PBE covers a portion of the biotech industry bigger names. SBIO biotech smaller niche companies with upcoming trials SKYY cloud computing sector. IVES cloud computing sector. CGW covers water for utilities amp; industrial. FIW covers clean water systems. VR covers VR. CIBR cyber security. QTUM quantum computers. HAIL covers autonomous vehicle tech. KARS covers EVs. BATT covers batteries and battery material. TAN covers solar. URA covers nuclear sector. MSOS covers cannabis. DBA agricultural. MOO covers agricultural chemicals and etc. AGG covers bond market. I have never done this before so I am looking for any guidance. It feels like a lot of different ETFs but I also want a set up to where I can just dump money into them every 3 months until I retire.",
        "JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF  10% yield...seems too good to be true. JEPI has a 10% yield . This is 24% better than junk bonds 7% better than TLT/IEF 6% better than LQD yet the chart is much smoother less downside. Seems almost too good to be true. gt;JEPI is an activelymanaged fund which seeks to generate income by investing in US stocks which have low volatility and which appear undervalued and through investments in equitylinked notes which provide the economic exposure of the US stock market and written sold call options. The fund is appropriate for investors seeking longterm income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally the options exposure of the equitylinked notes provides income but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market and exposes investors to counterparty risk. JEPI may be taxinefficient as distributions from the fund may be taxed as income and dividends from underlying stock holdings are not considered qualified because of the offsetting options positions. Source: wealthfronnt Since early 2021 it completely crushes AGG and has a better Sharpe than even SPY :  This is probably the best ETF I have seen in a long time. It has superior income to fixedincome but without interest rate risk.",
        "Bond Allocation  Bond Index Fund vs. Treasuries Ladder? Its a common investment advice to increase your bond allocation as you get closer to retirement. Almost all of them Ive read including in this subreddit is to do so by buying a total bond index fund like BND VBTLX or even AGG. But is it ok to instead directly buy treasuries especially if you can do it directly with your broker and even set up automatic repurchases and set up a treasury ladder. If so why dont people suggest this? With a Tbill ladder I can cash out by turning off automatic reinvesting and letting them mature no price risk/volatility or sell them yes price risk/volatility. In contrast the only way to cash out of bond funds is to sell which is risky because of volatility BND is currently down 16.07% YoY. As of 11/13/22 the 12 month treasury is yielding 4.53% whereas BND is yielding 2.44% and AGG is yielding 2.22%. Heck HYSAs at Capital One Marcus by Goldman Discover SoFi and Barclays are currently offering 3% APY Is there a downside to treasury ladders that Im missing? Does it make sense at all to hold ones bond allocation in bond index funds which are offering inferior yields are volatile and its so easy to instead buy and automatically reinvest in shortterm treasuries in brokerage accounts like Fidelitys?",
        "Is now a good time to start investing in Bonds? Currently in all equities early 40s but thinking about adding bonds via a bond fund like AGG or BND in addition to my treasury positions given the rates are still high enough.  1. Not sure if its a good time to get into bonds now or wait until the Fed is done with rate hikes.  2. Thinking about getting an intermediate maturity date vs short amp; long 3. Thoughts on purchasing a bond fund vs an individual intermediate bond?  Pros / Cons Thanks."

The table here shows how the market claws its way back in most years with fewer but sizable losses bringing the averages down. gt; The fact that November 2022 is up so far is supportive for continued upside. What stands out to us in this table is the rather solid performance for the Tuesday before ThanksgivingSanta Claus Rally trade as well as solid gains for the Santa Claus Rally itself. gt; We wish everyone a happy and festive Thanksgiving and hope that you all enjoy the time with friends and family gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Continuing Claims Flash Recessionary Warning gt; Due to tomorrows holiday this weeks jobless claims data was released a day early and were not exactly a release to be thankful for. The latest readings were bad all around with both initial and continuing claims rising more than expected. For initial claims last weeks level was revised up by 1K to 222K and this weeks reading rose by 18K to 240K. That is the highest level of claims since the week of August 18th and the sequential increase was the largest since the end of September. Whereas recent readings on jobless claims have been healthy in the sense that they have remained within the range of low readings from the few years prior to the pandemic this new high would have been at the high end of the 2008 to 2019 prepandemic range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On a nonseasonally adjusted basis the current week of the year typically sees claims move higher with a weekoverweek increase 82% of the time. However this weeks increase was around 10K larger than what the comparable week of the year has historically averaged. In other words from a seasonal perspective the rise in claims is perfectly normal in terms of direction but less so in terms of size. Now at 248K claims are in line with levels for the comparable weeks in 2021 and 2019. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Continuing claims continue to be the more interesting story around jobless claims. Delayed one week to the initial claims number continuing claims as of the week of November 11th rose for a sixth week in a row. As we noted last week such a streak of consistent increases in continuing claims has been rare especially in the years following the Global Financial Crisis. In fact the rise during the onset of the pandemic in 2020which lasted for 10 consecutive weekswas the only other notably lengthy streak post2009. Prior to that there have only been a handful of other times in which continuing claims have risen for 10 weeks or more. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As for the current rise in claims the latest increase leaves the reading at 1.551 million which is the highest level since the first week of March. From a historical perspective though that remains an impressively low reading and well below the prepandemic range even if it is rapidly deteriorating. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As for just how bad of a stretch it has been for continuing claims the 187K increase or 13.7% jump during the past six weeks would be by far the largest in over a decade outside of the start of the pandemic. Additionally such a large increase in the span of six weeks is consistent with increases from all prior recessions. In fact as claims have made their way off of historic lows the current increase is nearly the same size as the early 1990s recession and is even larger than those in the early 1980s and early 2000s. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  Speculators Smelting Shorts gt; As we do each Monday in last nights Closer we recapped the latest Commitments of Traders data from the CFTC. This data set provides a look at how speculators have positioned themselves long or short in various futures. We show those readings as a net percentage of open interest. In other words higher positive values indicate a much larger share of open interest is positioned long and vice versa for negative readings. gt; In the commodities space after longs backed out in a big way earlier this year readings have risen rapidly in gold silver copper and palladium futures. As for how sharp of turnarounds they have been the increase over the past two weeks rank in the top decile of all periods in data going back to the mid 1980s for each of the previously mentioned metals. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; For the most widely followed of these metals gold silver and copper this is only the 14th time on record each of their two week changes ranked in the 90th percentile or above in the same week without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent occurrence of such a large broad increase in major metals positioning was in July of 2014. gt; Although these readings indicate that speculators are increasingly placing long bets on these futures such data actually can be a bit of a messy indicator for forward performance. Although these readings indicate bullish sentiment forward performance is the opposite in the near term with dramatic underperformance relative to the norm one week later which we have seen play out so far. One month and three month performance tends to see further declines in these commodities as well which is not exactly unheard of for precious metals while it is dramatically weaker for the industrial metals. Six month performance is generally more in line with historical norms while the bullishness in positioning only seems to come through to price action one year out. One year average returns for gold silver and copper are much stronger than the norm although positivity rates are still just barely above 50/50. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  The Most Obvious Bear Market Rally Ever?  gt;  The stock market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people most of the time. Jesse Livermore gt; Ive noticed a trend the past few weeks and that is since the midOctober lows most commentators say we are obviously experiencing a bear market rally in stocks. But is it really so obvious? Remember as one of the greatest traders ever said the markets job is to fool the masses most of the time. Wouldnt it be something if this was actually the start of a new bullish phase and not just another bear market bounce? gt;  Whats a Bear Market? First things first what is a bear market rally? To me it is when stocks bounce potentially significantly only to eventually move back to new lows. Think about the 17% rally the Samp;P 500 saw over the summer only to roll back over and make new lows in October. Thats a bear market rally which is what most think is happening now. gt;  Calling This a Bear Market Rally Is Popular Heres the catch most stocks actually bottomed back in June. Thats right more 52week lows took place in June than in October so you could say weve been in a new bull market for five full months now. Not a popular take Im aware but one that could be happening. Not to mention small caps didnt break their June lows back in October. Remember there are a lot more small caps than there are large caps again suggesting the real lows took place in June not October. gt; Heres a very quick Google search of bear market rally and you can get a taste for what I mean about most thinking this is nothing more than a bear market rally. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2 gt; I do a lot of social media specifically Twitter and I must say that the amount of anger when stocks go higher is about as high as I can ever remember. Bullish tweets or stats are simply crushed by an angry mob. Given this is a family website I cant share some of the comments but lets just say being remotely bullish is frowned upon by most investors and traders right now. Again this is likely because some people believe it is so obvious to everyone this is only a bear market rally and new lows are a near certain but maybe it isnt so obvious. gt;  More Signs the Crowd Isnt In a Good Mood The great Stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger said We suffer more often in imagination than in reality. One might interpret that as we all worry too much and things really arent as bad as they seem. And this could be what is happening right now. We keep hearing how bad the economy is yet as Sonu noted last week the consumer is quite strong. In fact the fourth quarter is expected to see GDP growth of more than 3% according to the Atlanta Fed. Speaking of Seneca the Younger do you know who his father was? Seneca the Elder. Im serious that was his name. Gotta love Ancient Rome and its philosophers gt; Enough Ancient Roman jokes and back to why this likely isnt just a bear market rally and why it could be the start to a new bullish move higher. One of my favorite surveys is the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. This monthly survey asks real money managers what they expect and how they are positioned. The recent report showed cash was up 6.2% of a portfolio near the highest level since 2001 while a net 77% of respondents expected a global recession within 12 months. gt; But my favorite stat was 0% were looking for a goldilocks scenario. Take note this scenario would mean abovetrend growth and belowtrend inflation See BofA Global Fund Manager Survey chart below. I agree it would be quite hard to expect that right here and now but my takeaway is nearly no one is expecting good things to happen. Meaning expectations are historically low. As the chart below shows focus on the yellow line the last time it was this low was in late 2011 when all we heard about was the fiscal cliff drama out of Washington. Looking back 2012 2013 and 2014 were very solid years for both the economy and great years for the stock market. Given expectations got so low back then good news then sparked a much better stock market and we think a similar situation could be in play again as we head into 2023. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; George Orwell said To see what is in front of ones nose is a constant struggle. That is what is happening now in my opinion. Things are getting better yet people are focusing on the past and for some reason angry about good news. My take is dont be angry and embrace what could be better times and better news coming. gt; I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving week and you all enjoy eating way too much food with family and friends  gt;  Time to Feast ThanksgivingSanta Claus Rally Trade gt; Market action this past week and today has set up this annual market feast. Stocks have consolidated Octobers big gains in typical earlyNovember fashion setting the market up for the perennial yearend rally. gt; Since 1950 Samp;P 500 is up 80% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to the 2nd trading day of the year average gain 2.7%. Russell 2000 is up 79% of the time since 1979 average gain 3.4%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Thanksgiving kicks off a run of solid bullish seasonal patterns. NovemberJanuary is the years best consecutive 3month span 2023 STA p 149 and as we have been discussing all year we are at the outset of the Sweet Spot of the 4Year Cycle 2023 STA p 34. Then theres the January Effect 2023 STA pgs 112 amp; 114 of small caps outperforming large caps in January which nowadays begins in midDecember. gt; And of course the Santa Claus Rally 2023 STA p 118 invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac and often misunderstood is the short sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Pop also coined the phrase: If Santa Claus should fail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt; So we have combined these seasonal occurrences into one trade: Buy the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and hold until the 2nd trading day of the New Year.

        "Arbitrage Opportunity with IWM and SPY  During times of economic uncertainty or in high inflation environments RUT has a tendency to outperform the SNP500.   Furthermore the disparity between the SNP500 index and the RUT index shows that the last time it had this large of a difference was in 2003. Currently RUT/SPX value stands at 0.4604 with 0.6461 being close to the high. With the earnings of GOOG and MSFT being perceived as a beat last evening by the market the value will probably go slightly lower at todays open making it an even better entry point. Position: Long IWM and short SPY at a 2.18:1 ratio based on my entry last night/b Time horizon : 1  2 years or exit when inflationary environment subsides and steady economic expansion is the norm Other synthetic positions: Short bull call spreads on SPY and Long IWM bull call spreads This is harder t execute due to the exact 2.18 arb ratio  higher risk and theta decay due to high IV on IWM options"

        "SPY vs UPRO DIA vs UDOW I was wondering if a person is willing to just invest in the index for the long term and average down even in our current bear market situation. Couldnt they just buy the leveraged version instead for the long term? The losses may be magnified but so would the gains once the index recovers and make new highs 5 10 15 years later. Once an investment goal is achieved they probably shift it into SPY or DIA and live off the dividend with yields of 1.5% and 2% respectively. Any thoughts on this fellow investors?",
        "Do ETFs ever dissolve? How does that impact holders? When I was younger I played around with individual stocks made some big wins and a lot large losses. It basically ended up as a wash. As a result in recent years and as Ive started to make more money Im primarily in VGT NASDAQ tracking SPLG/SPY Samp;P500 tracking and DIA Dow Jones tracking. My weighting is roughly as follows: 60% tech 20% Samp;P500 10% Dow Jones 10% other ETFs / a couple small holdings My question is what is the risk of well known ETFs liquidating? For example I noticed SPY has been around since the mid 90s whereas SPLG has only been around since the mid 2000s. The underlying holdings are basically the same. Younger ETFs shouldnt be a cause for concern right? Maybe its a dumb question but I just got to thinking about the risk of liquidation. Im perfectly happy holding through the ups and downs though. Thanks",
        "I Recently Sold all of My Positions Besides VOO VTI DIA and SPGM. But I have a few questions One of them is when does liquidity become an issue? I decided to go with a sort of 3stock portfolio and I chose SPGM as my international choice instead of something like VXUS. I did this because SPGM at least pays dividends and has some US stocks so it seems at the least a bit safer. But SPGM has nearly no daily volume is that an issue? My next and last question is if this was even a good choice? I used to have a mixed basket of many different ETFs; ETFs ranging from a insurance ETFs to energy ETFs. The problem with my previous portfolio is that my stake in some ETFs became very inflated compared to my other positions. Therefore every time I decided to invest my head would spin because I didnt know what ETF to invest in to keep my perfect balance. About a week ago I sold all my specific ETFs and put all the money into VOO VTI DIA and SPGM where the breakdown is about 70% 15% 10% 5%. Main question: was this a bad move and I should have kept my very specific sector ETF strategy with a bunch of different ETFs? Can I still keep up with the market with the new strategy I chose? Etc etc. Just having a bit of sellers remorse when I see that some of the ETFs I sold went down less than my entire portfolio for the day.",
        "Should I buy individual stocks or ETFs or mix of both? I have a few stocks and ETFs currently. I am dollar cost averaging and putting in the same amount every Tuesday at 2pm for about a year now. I am only down 8% total which I guess is good year to date. I have about a 50/50 split ETF and individual stocks. Should I just use ETFs like HDV or DIA ?",
        "Taxable Account  Dividend Types I recently noticed SPY QQQ and DIA are considered nonqualified dividends for this 2022.  However in 2021 SPY and QQQ were under my qualified dividend bucket from fidelity.  Does anyone know how qualified amp; nonqualified are determined AND / OR noticed the same classification?  I invest a large chunk in these etfs via my taxable account so somewhat concerned having them here for the next 20 years.  Thanks."

        "What do TLT and BND track. Is it bond prices or bond yields? I am wondering if TLT and BND comove with bond prices and/or bond yields. If its yields is it the current yield? nominal yield? Or YTM? Also are these prices or yields based on older bonds or newer bonds. Sorry lots of questions but I am yet to find concrete answers on this. Thanks",
        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 8th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 8th 2022.  Samp;P 500 Nasdaq fall Friday but notch weekly gains after blowout July jobs report  Source  gt; Stocks wavered Friday in a volatile trading session after the July jobs report was much better than expected as investors assessed what a strong labor market would mean for the Federal Reserves rate tightening campaign.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76.65 points or 0.23% to end at 32803.47. Even with Fridays gains however it fell on the week. The Samp;P 500 shed 0.16% to end at 4145.19 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.50% Friday falling to 12657.56. Still both the Samp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the first week of August higher.  gt; Losses were offset by bank stocks which rose on hopes that interest rate hikes will continue at a solid clip. Energy stocks also gained but technology companies slumped.  gt; The labor market added 528000 jobs in July easily beating a Dow Jones estimate of a 258000 increase. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% below the 3.6% estimate. Wage growth also rose more than estimated up 0.5% for the month and 5.2% higher than a year ago signaling that high inflation is likely still a problem.  gt; Stocks opened lower following the report even as it seemed to indicate the economy was not currently in a recession. Job growth was expected to slow as the Fed continues to hike interest rates to tame inflation but this report shows a labor market still running hot. That means the central bank may act more aggressively at its next meeting.  gt; Anybody that jumped on the Fed is going to pivot next year and start cutting rates is going to have to get off at the next station because thats not in the cards said Art Hogan chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. It is clearly a situation where the economy is not screeching or heading into a recession here and now.  gt; Fridays jobs report is a crucial one as its one of two the central bank will see before it decides how much to raise rates at its September meeting. Indeed traders are already betting on a tougher stance from the Fed. Policy makers will have another jobs report and two more consumer price index numbers to weigh before the central bank makes its next rate decision.  gt; Major averages posted their best month since 2020 in July on the hope the Fed would slow the pace of its hikes. The Samp;P 500 added 9.1% last month.

Since the ETFs launch in 2002 only 3.1% of all trading days have been gains or losses of at least 2%. Not only was Friday a big move for TLT but it was also the third day this week that the ETF was up or down 2% on the trading day. Talk about an uncertain environment With investors looking to forecast the path and intensity of rate hikes against a backdrop of high inflation stronger than expected economic data like Fridays Payroll report puts upward pressure on yields while weaker than expected data suggests the economy is cooling off causing bonds to rally and yields to fall. gt; As mentioned above three of the last five trading days have seen daily moves of plus or minus 2%. Only two other periods throughout the history of TLT have seen a higher rate of 2% moves in TLT those being August of 2011 and March of 2020. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Since TLT was launched in 2002 there have only been 22 trading days in which the ETF had moved 2% three times over a trailing fiveday period. Those occurrences are shown on the chart below and they are clustered around three different periods  the Financial Crisis the US debt downgrade in 2011 and the COVID crash. Needless to say these were all very tumultuous periods in the markets and economy. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Interestingly there have been seven years since 2002 in which TLT has had less 2% percent daily moves than we have had in the last five days For the entire year this weeks three occurrences take the total number of 2% daily moves for TLT to 17. There are still five months left in 2022 but if there wasnt another day with a gain or loss of 2% this year would still rank fourth in terms of total 2% moves. Not only that but if this years pace were to continue it would put 2022 on track for a record twentynine 2% moves surpassing the prior record of 22 from 2011. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Bulls Battle Bears at June Highs Resistance gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The game is on as the market awaits tomorrows employment report and to see if the other shoe is going to drop on layoffs. Not to mention any deeper impact on the economy from inflation and the prospect of more aggressive rate increases from the Fed. gt; We are taking the excitement over the renewed bullish sentiment with a grain of salt. There was a similar rise in bullish sentiment at the end March as that rally stalled just before the bottom fell out. gt; Investors Intelligence Bulls/Bears Difference also rallied back above zero in lateMarch as it has the last few weeks. Red circles in the chart show comparable moves above zero during the 20082009 and 20152016 bears well before those bottoms. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; We may yet push a bit higher but our cycles and indicators are still pointing to a retest of the June lows with the potential for a lower low before the bottom over the next three months.  gt;  Bulls Back Above 30% gt; While the rally has paused today the Samp;P 500 has continued to press higher in the past week and is currently hovering near resistance at the late May/early June highs. In response to those moves investor sentiment has improved with the weekly survey from the AAII showing over 30% of respondents reporting as bullish. That is the highest reading since the first week of June when the Samp;P 500 was at similar levels to now. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Bearish sentiment is a similar story in hitting the lowest level since the first week of June as it has fallen back below 40%. The further 1.2 percentage point drop marks the fourth week in a row that bearish sentiment has fallen and the full decline since the recent high of 59.3% on June 23rd now sits at over 20 percentage points. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In spite of those further improvements there continues to be more bears than bulls as the spread remains in negative territory. As shown in the second chart below the bull bear spread has now been negative for 18 weeks in a row. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In addition to the drop in bearish sentiment neutral sentiment was also lower falling 1.6 percentage points down to 30.6%. That is the first time neutral sentiment matched bullish sentiment since May of last year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Strongest July in PostWWII Era gt; On Friday the Samp;P 500 closed over 140 basis points higher on the back of favorable earnings from Apple AAPL Amazon AMZN Chevron CVX and Exxon XOM. This was the third straight day in which the Samp;P 500 gained at least one percent allowing bulls to breathe a sigh of relief after a tough start to the year. These moves came even as a second consecutive quarter of negative real GDP growth was reported and the Fed hikes rates by 75 basis points. gt; Fridays move helped the Samp;P 500 post its best July in the postWWII era finishing with a gain of 9.2%. Although the index is still close to 14% off of its early January highs the market looks more inviting than it did at the beginning of the month when the YTD declines were above 20%. As investors we could just give ourselves high fives for the month but its vital to remain forwardlooking. Following July gains of 5% the Samp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.6% in August median: 1.4% performing positively 60 percent of the time. Between the start of August and the end of the calendar year the index has averaged a gain of 8.0% median: 10.0% gaining 80% of the time. Over the following twelve months starting in August the index has averaged an impressive gain of 15.6% median: 15.4% rallying 87% of the time. Based on past history bull runs in July tend to bode well for the market for both the rest of the year and over the following twelve months.

Most of the move to start August appears to a degree to be rotational in nature. In the chart below we show the average performance of deciles of Russell 3000 stocks grouped by their performance in the month of July. As shown both the best and worst performers last month have rallied in early August with the deciles of the worst performers seeing slightly larger gains. The losers this month have been in the middle of the performance spectrum as deciles 4 through 7 are each flat to lower over the past couple of sessions. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Equities bottomed in midJune and have been in rally mode ever since. As for how performance the past couple of days relates to the first half of the years declines again the worst performers have generally been outperforming. However by this measure the top performers from the 52week high just after the New Year through the low in June have continued to fall this week. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Hot Julys Often Bring LateSummer/Autumn Buys gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Inflation war recession fears aggressive Fed rate hikes lingering supply chain issues layoffs earnings misses and lingering pandemic issues drove the market into official bear market territory last month. gt; Driven by hopes of a soft landing a resilient labor market pockets of positive economic and corporate results and some rather seriously oversold conditions in big name tech and growth stocks the market has rallied smartly off the June lows. gt; At the end of July DJIA was up 9.9% from the June lows Samp;P up 12.6% and NASDAQ up 16.4. Summer rally 2022 has worked the bulls into a frenzy like a matador with his red muleta. DJIA logged its 7th best July since 1950 up 6.7% qualifying as a Hot July Market. gt; Gains of this magnitude for July however have frequently been followed by latesummer or autumn selloffs and better buying opportunities than now. In the past fullmonth July gains in excess of 3.5% for DJIA have been followed historically by declines of 7.2% on average in the Dow with a low at some point in the last 5 months of the year.  gt;  Initial Claims Back to the Highs gt; Initial jobless claims came in matching expectations at 260K this week up from last weeks downward revision of 254K. That reading leaves claims 1K below the pandemic high set two weeks ago. Those levels are above the prepandemic range and consistent with where claims stood in the fall of 2017. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On a nonseasonally adjusted basis claims have the benefit of seasonal tailwinds at this point of the year as the midsummer peak works itself out. Given this unadjusted claims have dropped to 205.6K from the high of 258.9K two weeks ago. Although that is a strong level of claims it is above the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to the initial claims number meaning the most recent reading is as of the week of July 22nd. Although initial claims had fallen that week continuing claims moved back above 1.4 million for the first time since midApril. Unlike initial claims and as we will discuss further in tonights Closer the deterioration in continuing claims has been relatively modest as current levels are not only well below levels from the two years prepandemic but this weeks reading would still make for some of the best readings since 1970. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies tickers reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "QQQ TLT and bitcoin down big on Friday but oil stabilizing With the Inflation Reduction Act now passed there will be serious ramp up in government spending just like after the fiscal stimulus bill in early 2021. TLT treasury bond etf is probably going down to new lows. Oil is flattening and possibly is ready to rally. Oil company etf XLE is now stronger on the charts than QQQ. Bitcoin and ethereum got hit hard. Fed officials are still hawkish and will be hawkish even moreso if oil starts to rally here. I think the oil and gas sector still looks good. I think XLE looks good. Other than shorting QQQ does anyone have any investment ideas for the coming weeks?",
        "Is Now the Time for Bond Funds Are we nearing the point to load up bond funds for a swing trade? Seems like after the September FOMC meeting it could be time to prepare for the inevitable pivot after they fuck everything up. Especially TLT EDV TMF Thoughts?",
        "Can someone explain the TLT 20yr Treasury play? Why some peeps long $TLT? I keep seeing various prognosticators talking up $TLT. Can someone explain to me why this is? From what I can gather its cause they think inflation will continue to sink growth  why how would that be reflected in yields?",
        "2 Year Treasury Hello fellow stock redditors. So yields are going crazy.  Long term and short term.  Clearly these will not be sustainable for a long time multiple years.  Atleast thats what I believe.  So at some point they will start coming down.  I believe we are closer to the top than the bottom on yield. So if someone wants to invest in 20 yr treasury bond TLT is one option to invest in.  Now I am trying to invest in a ticker which tracks the 2 year treasury note yield.  I have looked and probably I am not looking at the right place where can I see the securities specific tickers that are the 2 year treasury notes that I can invest in ?",
        "What broad impacts will the bond crash have? Bonds rose in value from 20122020 or so.   Now TLT has dropped 45% from peak.  This is bigger than the 25% bond crash of 2008.   Entities do not invest in bonds to lose 45% in 2 years.  This is not stocks.     What broad impacts will the bond crash have?",
        "What are the bear arguments for long term bond etfs like TLT or TMF? Seems like rates are going to hold steady and then down. Fed already signal it will have high rates longer but doesnt want to do anymore hikes on the already fragile economy. Seems like a long uptrend on bond etfs has started?",
        "Why this is a weird time and the market is erratic and volatile In a nutshell Ive come up with the following assessment based on my research that isnt calling a bottom or anything but is driving my investment strategy.   Since 2009 the market has been driven more by the Federal Reserve Fund Rate FFR that enabled a lot of companies to grow particularly in the tech industries due to easy debt availability.  The FFR was negative in real terms in relationship to true inflation rates and offshoring allowed for easy access to cheap labor on staples and manufacturing.  This allowed wages to be suppressed even in nonstaple industries.  An example is why your support phone calls to Dell are taken in Mumbai.  The CSRs are getting paid fractions of what US CSRs would receive for the same work.   The COVID shut downs of 2020 came with unemployment at 3.5% leading into it.  However there was stagnant wage growth at that time.  For reference sake average unemployment from 1948 until 2015 was 5.8%.  The Federal Reserve targets 5% unemployment as its target.  Above that isnt necessarily healthy because it leaves companies short staffed and doesnt allow for wage growth inline with the Feds target inflation rate of 2.5%.  Since wages were not increasing at a rate commiserate with inflation in real terms and because social security payouts were so low as well in terms of pre70 retirements older folks were working longer.  Then along came COVID.   COVIDbased lockdowns caused massive layoffs to the tune of a 1213% spike in unemployment.  The US went from 3.5% to 14.7% unemployment basically in the course of weeks.  The easing of the lockdowns took over a year.  The Federal Reserve and Congress response was to dump a ton of money in enhanced unemployment benefits drop nominal rates to zero and juice the stock market from a massive drop into a blowoff top with the Samp;P hitting 4800.  Suddenly a lot of 60 year olds retirement accounts got a lot more valuable.  There was a lot of incentive to stop working for a lot of people who historically would have been out of the workforce 510 years earlier.  This is tied to a demographic issue based on lower birth rates tied to stagnant wage growth higher debt levels and higher quality of life and fundamental shifts in how people chose to live life.   In lockstep the outsourced staples and manufacturing had inflation problems because the labor issues spread globally as entire continents locked down.  The entire global supply chain got for lack of a better term FUBARed.  This jacked shipping production and commodity prices on top of what had been developing upward pressure on those prices due to global climate concerns.  This caused inflation which is still manifesting.   Historically inflation cant be tamed until the FFR is positive in real terms rates above inflation rate.  We arent there yet but should get there by Q1 of 23.  History says a soft landing is not likely because the very thing the Fed has to do to tame inflation is recessionary.  Unemployment has to go up.  And thats the crux of why I am writing this:   Were in a weird time because unemployment isnt likely to give much of a care about rates.  Simply put the available labor force has contracted dramatically.  And this isnt really tracked well.  In 2021 there were massive spikes in new company registrations so a lot of people left the workforce to start their own little gigs likely in many cases with zero rate debt for startup costs and those likely arent being tracked that well.  The stock market which is essentially all very large companies feels this strain the worst because the only way they are going to keep up is by offering higher wages from the bottom to the top of their employment pay scales.  We will likely see continuing whitecollar job cuts and continuing pay and benefit raises at the bottom which vastly out number the top.  There is very little incentive these companies can provide without higher pay.  And no Fed changes will help this.  The job market is going to persist at a very tight state the demographics demand it.   All that will happen is that the Fed will tighten even into real positive rates of 67% and eventually the issue will be servicing US debt as a percentage of GDP.  It will hit a point stop and the pivot wont happen for a very long time back into easy monetary policy because the stagnation of the labor pool and avenues for selfemployment contradict the large corporate structure that has existed to this point.  My personal investment thesis right now is to maintain exposure in solid mature companies preferably with dividends emerging market exposure into places with positive demographic trends India South Africa and buy bonds when the fed announces a stop to rate hikes because I think they will largely outperform the market in the 25 year term until the pivot to rate cuts probably 2H 2024 due to political pressure and the ever increasing appetite by the general populace for entitlements.   At that point buying TLT will be how somebody could get very very wealthy and since that is not some secret anymore that could reignite the entire cycle.  Because it will happen at that scale.  Institutional money will absolutely clobber that trade.",
        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022.  Dow tumbles 300 points Friday posts worst week since September  Source  gt; Stocks finished lower Friday with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points or 0.9% to close at 33476.46. The Samp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3934.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11004.62.  gt; On a weekly basis the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The Samp;P tumbled 3.37% while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.  gt; Fridays moves came after Novembers producer price index showed higherthanexpected wholesale prices which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI which excludes food and energy also topped expectations.  gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears but attention remains laserfocused on next weeks busy economic calendar.  gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.  gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Feds aggressive tightening stance but the data fails to support that desire said Stephanie Lang chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.  gt; Its our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers she said. Theres still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.  gt; In other news shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weakerthanexpected fourthquarter outlook.

Since 1982 DJIA has advanced 30 times during Decembers options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. Samp;P 500 has a similar although slightly softer record. gt; However the record is not pristine. Last year accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018 DJIA and Samp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011 Europes debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012 the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after. gt; Going into next week the markets bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%4.50%. Todays slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  More Positive Signs for Inflation gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022 and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest most important economic event of our lifetime aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday today well look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing. gt; First up the consumer price index was up more than 9% yearoveryear in June but has since come back to 7.7% and we expect the trend to continue lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people arent paying as much for stuff there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows services prices have been more stubborn but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43 cut in half from March. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year but should it turn lower it could be a nice tailwind. Although the governments data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year and the trend remains firmly lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month so safe to say this is a widespread trend. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Once again government data lags behind private data and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases while private indices consider just new ones. Also for the official data rental units are sampled only every six months given that rents arent renegotiated very often. For this reason we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 812 months. gt; Additionally CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% backtoback months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth. gt; Lastly used car prices continue to sink. According to their data the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down yearoveryear 14.2% the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices the governments data tends to be slow to get with the picture so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the governments data more over the coming months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared we think it could come back down in 2023 and things like rents prices paid and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This of course would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.  gt;  Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings gt; Sentiment tipped over before the Samp;P 500s rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This weeks reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% a reading in the middle of this years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Overall sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 SPY December Drop gt; The Samp;P 500 SPY has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally SPY did manage to move back above its 200DMA but it couldnt quite get above the past years downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today and while further declines could result in a break down it would also mark an impressive but not exactly unheard of streak of declines. As shown below it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact this months 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY since inception and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines both of those previous instances saw larger drops roughly around 4.5% than the 3.5% decline currently. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2  gt;  Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day. As shown below SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy XLE is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary XLY and Financials XLF. Utilities XLU is down the least so far in December at just 0.50%. gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The AllWorld exUS ETF CWI and the Emerging Markets ETF EEM are both down just 1.2% MTD and the AllWorld exUS ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence. gt; For most of the year heading into December we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks but recently as stocks have dropped bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month with the 20 Year Treasury TLT up the most at 4.35%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below of the yeartodate percentage change total return of the Nasdaq 100 QQQ and the 20 Year Treasury ETF TLT is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month QQQ is down 3.98% while TLT is up 4.35% but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  BacktoBack Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Chances are you have already heard about the Samp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest Samp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance followed by 8.0% in October 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable up 13.79% in two months. gt; Based upon the Bull amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Traders Almanac all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020 2009 2002 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish but choppy during the 1month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21year Seasonal Pattern for December. gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the Samp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 1520 trading days after the streaks end. Following this period the Samp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1year after the streak ended.ail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  When does the Santa Claus Rally Start? gt; As we noted on the blog last week December is historically a strong month for stocks and we dont expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the thirdbest month for the Samp;P 500 since 1950 April and November are stronger and thirdbest during a midterm year with October and November better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt; Taking things a step further though when does Santa come to town? One of the most wellknown investment axioms is the Santa Claus Rally and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December but this isnt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me given that this is when Santa comes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "With a good PCE is TLT/TMF a good buy right now? I saw a post about someone that bought 33 million in Jan 2023 $135 calls a few months ago.That got me interested and I did some research. I went ahead and picked up a few at varying strikes. My reasoning is that with the PCE lower than expected we may have seen the worst of inflation. And dropping gas prices combined with decreased consumer inflation we may see lower than expected rate increases. I honestly dont completely understand the bond market but from what I can tell they are poised for a big rally. Especially after the recession is officially announced.",
        "People who understand bonds/TLT what are they telling us about the existing/upcoming market and do they have the potential to spike again Looking at longdated bond ETFs like TLT specifically or ZTL as a Canadian Im trying to get a better understanding of what theyre telling us and just general thoughts from bond investors or at least people trading TLT. Im not near retirement so usually 0% in bonds but I look at how they spiked in the lead up to Covid  or really how theyve held in previous bear events or even spiked and am really starting to consider putting some of my cash position in long bonds in case they do a repeat of Q1Q2 2020 as Im bearish on the equity market in general plus TLT is at a multiyear low. Looking at TLT this week it didnt like what the Fed said even though the equity market did. If my base case is that the Fed will continue to push up rates past neutral even if they slow down how much they do it then can I expect TLT to keep going down? What if theres a sharpish decline in the rest of the market will they correlate to the market like they did earlier this year and go down as well or will they perform like theyre supposed to as a flight to safety?",
        "Inverse relationship between SPX and TLT appears to have ended its long run. Looking back to the 08 crisis until now this last downturn from Dec 21 until now is the only time investors havent flocked to bonds. Stocks and treasuries have  both been beaten down. From a structural  standpoint where is that money flowing? It seems the rotation has stopped. If its all cash its gotta go somewhere eventually. Thoughts on how this plays out?",

        "Bond ETF valuation mechanics not behaving any ideas why? I have held a longterm option short position with TLT for a few years now expecting that it would take a hit when interest rates rise since bonds held would need to be discounted once interest rates change significantly. Ive looked at the assets and value of what theyve disclosed for the fund in the published documentation and after the first interest rate change it should have dropped significantly. I waited and it didnt despite the prospectus claiming to rebalance regularly with the index. Since then there have been several other increases in the default interest rate and the fund hasnt moved or appeared to rebalance these changes at all. Any ideas why this Bond ETF hasnt dropped? The assets the fund holds appear to me to be worth at least 3040% less than the current market value. Given the interest rate hikes but the ETF market price hasnt been impacted at all. Id like your take on this since it appears I must be missing something. Disclaimer: Ive since exited my holdings in this ETF with exception to several contracts that will no doubt expire worthless by EOY or shortly after.  Not seeking investment advice simply trying to understand what I am missing here.",
        "Best Treasury bond ETF to buy right before the Fed slashes rates from 4.5% to 0%? Why isnt TLT performance inverted vs SHY this year? Help me reconcile the seemingly contradictory price action between the US Treasury yield curve and treasury ETFs this year.  The hypothetical scenario is in the title. On the surface I thought SHY 13 yr bonds average maturity 1.9 yrs would be a good idea for my scenario since they inhabit the portion of the yield curve affected the most by the Feds activities while being the soonest to mature.  However despite the spiking of rates this year they are only 4.4% YTD vs TLT 20yr bonds being down 25.7% .  I can memorize the fact longer duration is more sensitive to interest rates so ZROZ is best but I dont understand why.  Im missing something.  Explain this to me as if I wear a mask in my car by myself.",
        "TLT and longterm rates question I have recently taken an interest in the longterm bond fund tlt. Its probably familiar to many readers of this post. My thesis is buying in small portions every time interest rates goes higher I suspect they will untill q1 23 then try to buy a bit more when rates start to fall. If inflation expectations and long rates fall from 5 to say around 2 we should see a large and very safe upswing in the value of tlt and other longterm bonds funds. This tactic Ive been practicing in the game WSR and its immensely effective and profitable if you have the time horizon and the funds for it. However theres one thing about this ETF I dont get and thats the yield. I see from the official long bond rates that they are at around 4% yet this fund yields only 2% ?. What exactly does that mean...will the yield catch up as the etf rolls over its positions? Or is it already priced down because of its large holdings of lowyielding bonds I think most are from 0.52.5 or around there. Any insight into this and my general investment idea here? Cheers and GL.",
        "JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF  10% yield...seems too good to be true. JEPI has a 10% yield . This is 24% better than junk bonds 7% better than TLT/IEF 6% better than LQD yet the chart is much smoother less downside. Seems almost too good to be true. gt;JEPI is an activelymanaged fund which seeks to generate income by investing in US stocks which have low volatility and which appear undervalued and through investments in equitylinked notes which provide the economic exposure of the US stock market and written sold call options. The fund is appropriate for investors seeking longterm income. JEPI is subject to equity market risk and risk that its security selection process underperforms the broader market. Additionally the options exposure of the equitylinked notes provides income but limits the upside potential of the fund relative to the US stock market and exposes investors to counterparty risk. JEPI may be taxinefficient as distributions from the fund may be taxed as income and dividends from underlying stock holdings are not considered qualified because of the offsetting options positions.

        "The best stocks or sector ETFs to own during rising rates? Tldr; I just want to know your top ETFs stocks you have bought for the rising rate environment and why? Below is my just my current reasoning as well as some of my favorite   Ive recently rebalanced my 401k to be pretty diversified into ETFs and am looking to increase my exposure in my retail account to single stocks Ive bought plenty of tech stocks over the last few years and sold them off during the fall of 2021. Im very bullish on tech but I dont want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their moms have a different feeling on where the economy is heading but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info and that as of right now is that rates will go up probably beyond 3% and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with Chinas economy Covid/MP Supply chains Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.   So my question is what stocks individual or sector based ETFs do you believe will perform within the next 23 years as rates rise to 3%?   Ive done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow   My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy for now is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks most notably BAC.   My third pick would be a suite of DSF Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher inflation they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years the P/Es are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.   My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin Raytheon and Boeing.    To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV Tracks price of silver and GDX Gold Miners ETF along with UNH stock which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.   My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials 15% Defense/Aero 20% Precious Metals 10% Healthcare UNH   10% In Wells Fargo 10% XLF 20% Financials 5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials  Consumer Credit 5% Silvergate Capital this carries the highest risk in my opinion but Im bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.   5% BA 5% Raytheon 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace   10% SLV 10% GDX  20%  Precious Metals/Commodities   10% UNH stock  Healthcare   After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months Ive found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market technology would be going up or down but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks inflation and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldnt find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97 a share after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening and I dont want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear I want to make decisions based off a trajectory thats most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses as well as adding defensive stock like LHM RTX and Boeing which I think will have always been great names but now was the time to add to them for exposure.    I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me so a small update and where Im invested now.   20% BRKB  10% QQQ  10% VTI  10% VIG  10% HYG  20% GDX  20% ICLN   I do enjoy holding individual stocks but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio after maxing out to 20500/year and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETFs I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing Im financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.   I dont expect people to read this far but if you do what are your top stocks/ETF sector specific for the next 2 years and why?"

        "Forward P/E of Samp;P IWM MDY and some stocks that look good. For anyone interested forward P/E Samp;P 17 IWM 10.5 MDY 11.6 That is one of the lowest P/E for the IWM since the pandemic low and almost at 2008 levels. For anyone that is into charts.  There was a bullish five day/13day EMA crossover on the IWM and the MDY for the first time since July 19.  The IWM still needs to break recent highs 176/177 and the MDY 430 zone.

        "Chevron Exxon up in premarket as energy sector earnings reports start to roll in adding to industrial growth story Results from Chevrons amp; Exxons earnings reports reflect not just higher margins from higher energy prices but significant increase in production as US energy producers begin to take market share from other oil producers e.g. Russia. These reports add weight to the industrial growth story that has been shaping up so far this week. HOWEVER will this result in higher stock prices in the near term? Maybe not. Firstly the energy sector could always suffer the sell the news effect just like any other industry can and everyone was expecting great results from earnings reports. Secondly the possibility of the stillovervalued tech sector/mega caps dragging down the broader indexes can always lead to investors dumping their index ETF positions which of course drags everything down with it. On the other hand everyone who wanted to avoid a correction might already be out of the market. In any case any near term broadmarket selloff should be a good buying opportunity for anyone who wanted to get into industrial stocks but feels they missed the boat.  Exxon: 3Q 2022 earnings overview earnings call at 8:30 a.m. EDT today can join the webcast from this page gt; Grew earnings and cash flow from operating activities to $19.7 billion U.S. GAAP and $24.4 billion respectively as strong volume performance including record refining volumes rigorous cost control and higher natural gas realizations more than offset lower crude realizations and weaker industry refining margins.

CVX 0.46% rallied 2.4% toward a record high in premarket trading Friday after the oil and gas giant reported thirdquarter profit revenue and free cash flow beat expectations by wide margins as total oilequivalent production from U.S. upstream operations increased by nearly 50000 barrels per day. Net income jumped to $11.23 billion or $5.78 a share from $6.11 billion or $3.19 a share in the year ago period.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022.  Dow tumbles 300 points Friday posts worst week since September  Source  gt; Stocks finished lower Friday with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points or 0.9% to close at 33476.46. The Samp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3934.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11004.62.  gt; On a weekly basis the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The Samp;P tumbled 3.37% while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.  gt; Fridays moves came after Novembers producer price index showed higherthanexpected wholesale prices which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI which excludes food and energy also topped expectations.  gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears but attention remains laserfocused on next weeks busy economic calendar.  gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.  gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Feds aggressive tightening stance but the data fails to support that desire said Stephanie Lang chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.  gt; Its our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers she said. Theres still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.  gt; In other news shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weakerthanexpected fourthquarter outlook. DocuSign jumped on strong results.

Here are the upcoming IPOs for this week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Fridays Stock Analyst Upgrades amp; Downgrades:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK 1  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK 2  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK 3  gt;  Quarterly Options Expiration Historically Bullish gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In fact the week of options expiration and the week after have the most bullish record of all quarterly option expirations page 108 Stock Traders Almanac 2022 amp; 2023 Almanac. Since 1982 DJIA has advanced 30 times during Decembers options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. Samp;P 500 has a similar although slightly softer record. gt; However the record is not pristine. Last year accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018 DJIA and Samp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011 Europes debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012 the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after. gt; Going into next week the markets bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%4.50%. Todays slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  More Positive Signs for Inflation gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022 and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest most important economic event of our lifetime aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday today well look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing. gt; First up the consumer price index was up more than 9% yearoveryear in June but has since come back to 7.7% and we expect the trend to continue lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people arent paying as much for stuff there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows services prices have been more stubborn but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43 cut in half from March. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year but should it turn lower it could be a nice tailwind. Although the governments data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year and the trend remains firmly lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month so safe to say this is a widespread trend. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Once again government data lags behind private data and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases while private indices consider just new ones. Also for the official data rental units are sampled only every six months given that rents arent renegotiated very often. For this reason we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 812 months. gt; Additionally CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% backtoback months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth. gt; Lastly used car prices continue to sink. According to their data the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down yearoveryear 14.2% the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices the governments data tends to be slow to get with the picture so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the governments data more over the coming months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared we think it could come back down in 2023 and things like rents prices paid and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This of course would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.  gt;  Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings gt; Sentiment tipped over before the Samp;P 500s rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This weeks reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% a reading in the middle of this years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Overall sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 SPY December Drop gt; The Samp;P 500 SPY has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally SPY did manage to move back above its 200DMA but it couldnt quite get above the past years downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today and while further declines could result in a break down it would also mark an impressive but not exactly unheard of streak of declines. As shown below it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact this months 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY since inception and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines both of those previous instances saw larger drops roughly around 4.5% than the 3.5% decline currently. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2  gt;  Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day. As shown below SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy XLE is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary XLY and Financials XLF. Utilities XLU is down the least so far in December at just 0.50%. gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The AllWorld exUS ETF CWI and the Emerging Markets ETF EEM are both down just 1.2% MTD and the AllWorld exUS ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence. gt; For most of the year heading into December we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks but recently as stocks have dropped bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month with the 20 Year Treasury TLT up the most at 4.35%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below of the yeartodate percentage change total return of the Nasdaq 100 QQQ and the 20 Year Treasury ETF TLT is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month QQQ is down 3.98% while TLT is up 4.35% but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  BacktoBack Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Chances are you have already heard about the Samp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest Samp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance followed by 8.0% in October 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable up 13.79% in two months. gt; Based upon the Bull amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Traders Almanac all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020 2009 2002 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish but choppy during the 1month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21year Seasonal Pattern for December. gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the Samp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 1520 trading days after the streaks end. Following this period the Samp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1year after the streak ended.ail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  When does the Santa Claus Rally Start? gt; As we noted on the blog last week December is historically a strong month for stocks and we dont expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the thirdbest month for the Samp;P 500 since 1950 April and November are stronger and thirdbest during a midterm year with October and November better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt; Taking things a step further though when does Santa come to town? One of the most wellknown investment axioms is the Santa Claus Rally and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December but this isnt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me given that this is when Santa comes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 19th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 19th 2022.  Dow closes more than 200 points lower falls for a second straight week as recession fears grow  Source  gt; Stocks dropped Friday building on their yearend selloff as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points or 0.85% to 32920.46. The Samp;P 500 fell 1.11% to 3852.36. Meanwhile the techheavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10705.41.  gt; The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The Samp;P 500 fell 2.08% for the week and putting its December losses at 5.58% as hopes for a yearend rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7% respectively.  gt; Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring the highest amount relative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points before paring back some of those losses.  gt; The selloff was broadbased with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point there were only 10 Samp;P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards down nearly 3% and 1.7% respectively.  gt; Stocks fell this week in the wake of the Feds 50 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday  the highest rate in 15 years. The central bank said it would continue hiking rates through 2023 to 5.1% a larger figure than previously expected.  gt; Following the policy update the Dow dropped 142 points on Wednesday plunged 764 points Thursday and declined further on Friday.  gt; At the beginning of the week we had the hope given the very soft CPI number that we could expect the Fed and maybe the other central banks of the world to be less hawkish Bokeh Capital founder Kim Forrest said.  gt; But because they didnt and they had some stern words for investors and consumers alike that they were really focused on getting inflation down quickly that has taken away a lot of our hope for a soft landing Forrest added.

I can see Yales big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street. gt; They argue their case for why the Santa Claus Rally will or wont come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972 published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord it is still misunderstood. Its not a trading strategy its an indicator gt; SCR is the short sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Samp;P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year. gt; To wit Yales famous line: If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call Bears May Come To Broad And Wall. Stock Traders Almanac 2023 p 118. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. Its working inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while. gt; But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge. gt; Stocks tend to bottom here in midDecember ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month especially small caps  what used to be the January Effect. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our January Indicator Trifecta the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972 will help solidify our outlook for next year. gt; When all three are up the Samp;P 500 has been up 90% of the time 28 of 31 years with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the years results are reduced and when all three are down the Samp;P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of 3.6% with bear markets in 1969 11.4% 2000 10.1% and 2008 38.5% flat years in 1956 2.6% 1978 1.1% and 2005 3.0%. Down Trifectas were followed by gains in 1982 14.8% and 2016 9.5%. gt; Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our January Indicator Trifecta FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit. gt; We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks the Sweet Spot of the 4Year Cycle Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of preelection year.  gt;  5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets gt; I am an optimist because I dont see the point in being anything else. Abraham Lincoln gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market today I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets. gt; First things first we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023 which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here. gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market we are using the traditional definition which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes there isnt much difference between 19.8% and 20.0% so we will also include some near bear markets as well but when we say bear market that is what we mean. gt; First do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they dont as stocks indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987 which all took place without a recession. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Second taking things a step further here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some near bear markets this time to get more instances. Plus a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24% and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low this was right on the bullseye. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact the last three bear markets that didnt have a recession recovered in four four and three months. Something to think about here as stocks are two months off the October lows. gt; Third this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023 this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly bears dont end for another nine months on average after the recession started before they find their ultimate low. Again we dont see a recession so this wouldnt be the case now but the data is quite compelling. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Fourth the month of October tends to be a bearmarket killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October more than any other month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Below we break down those previous 17 bear or near bear markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October and we think theres a very good chance number seven just happened. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Fifth and lastly if October was indeed the bear market low be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bearmarket lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022 it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term. gt; Dr. Seuss said Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple. To me bear markets can be confusing and complicated but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end and historically better times will come when they do.  gt;  2022 US Stock Market Snapshot gt; With just a couple more weeks left in the year the Samp;P is down 18.2% yeartodate which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below weve seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If Decembers declines hold well have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has so far been the worst month with a decline of 9.3% while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance Mondays Thursdays and Fridays have averaged declines this year while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Energy Losing Its Grip gt; You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? Thats what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the Samp;P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the Samp;P 500 has moved higher. Last week the sector broke below its 50DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50DMA on 12/6 the sector has made multiple intraday attempts including today to get back above it but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level its often a sign of a momentum shift. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; On a relative strength basis the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the Samp;P 500 SPY over the last year. During that time Energys relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week but at this point the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months so its only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well but with the sector already breaking below its 50DMA this is a key trendline to watch. If the sectors relative strength weakens further the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldnt shed a tear for. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE  gt;  The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023 gt; First the good news  gt;  The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points bps to the 4.254.50% range  a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected but its always good to see confirmation. gt;  They also said that ongoing rate increases will be necessary and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023 which was not a big surprise. Whats important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021 they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6%  1% increments every three months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The notsogood news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy which wasnt great. gt;  They revised economic growth lower from 1.2% to 0.5% 2023 gt;  They revised the unemployment rate higher from 4.4% to 4.6% about 1% point higher than where it is now gt;  They revised core inflation higher from 3.1% to 3.5% 2023 gt; While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they dont believe these forecasts qualify as a recession keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession. gt; But if you notice I said not so good news instead of bad news. Powell pointed out that these are members best estimates as of today but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting when they update the projections again we have three more inflation reports three employment reports and an employment cost index report which is a preferred gauge of wage growth. gt; If you look back at the previous chart weve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. Theres no reason to think we wont see more revisions if the data cooperates. gt;  The shift: From how fast and how high to how long gt; The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve Fed looked to get on top of inflation. The Feds singular focus was to ensure they did more than enough to lower inflation. Consequently the overarching question on investors minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates and how high they would go. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; I believe thats going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didnt mention it again in his postFOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that while the report was encouraging they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so theyll keep rates sufficiently restrictive. gt; I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023 especially if energy prices dont spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents which are falling rapidly. All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen. gt; So the question for investors will also shiftfrom how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line  there may be fits and starts and false alarms but the trend is clear. gt;  The risk of transitory deflation gt; What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services education childcare costs wireless services insurance fees etc.  all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As you can see the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about how long to stay restrictive. gt; I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.  gt;  Is Anyone Bullish? gt; The future aint what it used to be. Yogi Berra gt; Weve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago the future aint looking too good. gt; The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Heres a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Adding to this for one of the first times ever Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the Samp;P 500 next year. That just doesnt happen or it didnt happen until now. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Weve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday I saw this headline adding to the festive mood. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are two more signs of nearhistoric levels of skepticism. First the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words lower than the financial crisis and COVID. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Second our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index IMX which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again not a lot of excitement out there. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Theres an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or as General Patton said If everyone is thinking alike somebody isnt thinking. gt; What could spark it? Itll likely be better trends in inflation which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here. gt; It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The Samp;P 500 was down two years in a row in 73 and 74 one of the worst recessions ever then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s thats it. Even during the financial crisis stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009. gt; As the table below shows it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror as what just happened likely wont happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year likely where we land in 2022 they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now to be clear we arent saying stocks will gain 25% next year But we are saying it isnt as crazy as it sounds. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Warren Buffett said Someones sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. Things havent been good for investors this year but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.  gt;  VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for Samp;P 500 over Next 2 Weeks gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On Friday December 9 a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index VIX. A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like Samp;P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure nearterm market volatility the lower it goes the better the Samp;P 500 usually performs. Thus a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication. gt; Going back to 1990 including the most recent cross there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The Samp;P 500s average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross Samp;P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross Samp;P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days. gt; Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross the 50day moving average crosses above the 200day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for Samp;P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later. gt; In following tables we present the Samp;P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the nearterm 1and 2week Samp;P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross but by 1month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the nearterm but not a great indication much beyond 2weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Is now is the time to buy energy? XLE looks tempting. I keep reading that the strategic oil supply is low the Saudis arent wanting to pump more and Russia is showing no signs of withdrawing from Ukraine so shouldnt energy be in demand for at least the winter and probably beyond?

        "Adding sector specific ETFs or keeping only broader market ETFs? Im looking to potentially rework my portfolio a bit and I was considering trying to add some sector ETFs into my ETF portion of my portfolio. Right now its mainly things like VTI VOO AVUV VXUS and VYM. I was thinking of adding things like XLF XLE or XLP to focus on specific industries but I was wondering if it was worth it historically to add emphasis on certain sectors or if I should just keep it broad focusing on things like total market large cap vs small cap value vs growth etc. Thoughts?",
        "Invest in a single Broad Index ETF vs Multiple Sector EFTs? I am setting up a weekly recurring investment in ETrade which allows for partial ETF buys with automation. I am considering just a single lump buy of VOO or VTI vs breaking the purchase up into equally smaller buys into a spread like this. VGT VNQ XLF VPU VDC XLE VHT BND SCHD ARKK. I am aware the VOO/VTI vs sector ETFs are not equivalent but are there any benefits to being more specific in what I buy rather than just doing VOO/VTI? I like the idea of being able to tailor and customize percentages specifically into a sector as market conditions change and also seeing performance by sector over time."

        "Whats your portfolio construction  of stocks/sector weights/nonequities? When I talk to buddies that manage money for a living the sad answer I get is either one of two things: Pretty much all Russel/Samp;P ETFs or super concentrated into a few punts usually in their alleged area of expertise worst was a guy that covers Uts and that made up 80% of his PA. The former makes some sense since most legit firms have coverage restrictions and holding requirements so its a real pain in the ass and your income/wealth is already proxy geared to your ability to not suck at picking stocks. The latter thoughweird. They should know better. Anyway Im curious what nonindustry people are doing with their own money. Are you balanced by sector weight? Do you hold 5 stocks or 40? Are you in alts or God forbid bonds? Ill go first: 1 Stocks: 16 2 Sector Benchmark Weights: Not even close. Im a former stock picker at a mutual fund covering healthcare and bit of tech before I started making YouTube videos in my basement in quasi retirement. HC and Tech Info Tech plus the shiny parts of CD and Comm. Services stocks are around 40% of my portfolio. Another 20% in other names but as a former growth investor its all pretty growthy and no RE UTs Mats or Energy the latter two I mess around in commodity form in ETFs. Other 40% is in ETFs  Samp;P always and I punt around other stuff on spec. Typically the Nasdaq Biotech Index IBB Russel 2K QQQ and some odd ball stuff like USO before the invasion and more recently a Chinese Tech ETF even made a video on it. 3 NonEquites: A few of the mainstream cryptos on and off since 2017 thank f not anymore and thats it. I dont plan on touching a bond until Im 65. Anyway curious what everyone else is doing. Figure since Im not picking stocks for a living anymore I should run a more big kid portfolio. Keen to hear some different allocation ideas. And if anyone has any qs happy to do my best to provide feedback and any teensy guidance I can.",
        "How will USO and OIL be affected with the BP fire? With the fire at the BP refinery in the Midwest this should limit the supply of gasoline and cause gas prices to go up in those states and possibly across the U.S. the question is will this have a small impact on oil stocks or will it significantly drive the price of oil up.",
        "Should a person be investing in oil now that it is at a 1 year low? My personal opinion: Yes I typically am the person people close to me go to for stock advice. Stocks are fairly easy to predict the next 12 month trajectory  oil on the other hand is a commodity and therefore is not able to like a stock be looked at using a P/E ratio one of the best to determine how to trade a stock. Is now the time for people to pile into investing in oil? Or should we not touch oil due to the high probability of a recession in 2023? Reasons to not trade oil over the next 1 year:  Winter was supposedly going to be horrible in many European countries we all have seen that 2 minute video from Russia trying to show Europe freezing over in the winter and oil was supposed to soar ... That is not the case anymore  as oil reserves have been filled and everything should be fine.  Speaking more long term oil really is just not going to be around decades from now and even if this is wrong much more money can be made in other investments Reasons to trade oil over the next 1 year:  If there seems to be something wrong with the price of oil it is slapping me in the face right now and that is the following: WTI Jan. 23 as of 1:30pm = $70.33... Look at any 10 year  or 5 year chart and you will quickly see oils average over 10 years or 5 years is above what it is currently trading at. Bottom line: I will be buying up oil stocks and will dip my toes into ETFs including USO and OILU OILU is a leveraged oil futures ETF if and only if oil dips below $65 in the coming 2 weeks. I believe we will have a global recession and will try to swing trade oil stocks/ETFs before a potential massive dip takes place. I do see even with oil reserves in Europe being full right now a steady rise in oil prices in the west over the next 3 months hopefully timed before any sort of broader market slide.",

        "bullish on lithium rough numbers There were 6.6 million EV sold in 2021 avg total vehicles sold per year in last 10 years = 70million this equates to 9.5% market share. With the ESG guidance and goal at 2030 to have 100% of new car sales EV.  No hybrids are not included because they run on lead acid batteries. You have 6.5 years to reach 100% market share or 10.6x current value. Current LTH futures value = 75$ per kg current lithium etf LIT= $70 per share. Cost per car battery = 3k actual replacement cost 16k or 13500  labour. So I dont see this as a car manufacturer play because there margins will eventually come down as the commodity price rises. Currently lithium etf has been growing 50% yoy last 2 years with 200% growth from 52 week lows. Do you see lithium being 700per kg in 2029? So the cost of car battery alone will be 26000 not including margin and labour this is for 40kg of lithium total amount required for 1 EV battery currently. Maybe but Im more interested in LIT as the smart play and can see it out trading its counter part LTH and reaching 700 a share. Why would this not play out.

Lost about half from that glorious top last year. Better than Cathie Wood though yay BTW remember 2020? Everyone loved Cathie. Genomic revolution yada yada. Now everyone hates Cathie of course. ARK will probably be around for a while but Zoom is not going to $1500 by 2026. Are you kidding me Cathie? Fire those interns aka analysts asap. Ok enough about Cathie. So after 20/21 marvelous returns around 100% combined I thought..holy s this is great I got this...going to pay off my wife medical school loan earlier a tip: dont marry anyone with medical school loan debt maybe we will get bigger house you know man can dream well now at 6% interest rates plus houses being ridiculously overpriced this is not happening regardless of how stock market is doing.  Then 2022 came... Well I shifted a good chunk of portfolio into GOOGL/AMZN from growth last year about 20% allocation but that didnt help much. Biotech in particular has been in BRUTAL bear marker ever. Btw average investor should NOT touch biotechs especially small cap ones. But if you want to gamble and lose money anyway in the end sure go ahead and invest in biotechs especially development stage ones. What I learned though during this bear market well energy or big pharma bros would say what bear market are you talking about that your conviction absolutely helps you to hold on to equities during steep corrections. If you did enough due diligence and know what you own you most likely will stick around even after gt; 50% decline. If you bought something on borrowed conviction then most likely you are shaken out by this time. Hang in there folks better times will come unless of course you bought oversized position in Teladoc or Carvana on top  Bear markets are unavoidable. We just need to be mentally prepared for those. Macro bros / FCF experts / perma bears think we are going way lower. The thing is that nobody knows. I continue DCAing at this point. I wont catch a bottom and I dont need to honestly. Also all sectors do NOT decline equally as well. If SPY corrects other 20% from here that does not necessarily mean that XBI for instance will follow. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Top 3 holdings: GOOGL NET AMZN praying for the rest. EDIT: its pretty amazing how Im getting blamed in the comments for giving people advices Are you kidding me?

        "Stocks Rise Thursday; Meme Stocks Rally Yield Curve Remains Inverted During trading Thursday 18 stocks traded to a 52week high while 25 stocks bottomed out at new 52week lows. The Samp;P 500 is up 1.47% so far today while the Dow is up 1% the Nasdaq is up 2.29% and the Russell 2000 is up 2.54%. Stocks are higher Thursday afternoon. Cryptos are rallying. The yield curve is remaining inverted today as 10year Treasury yields remain lower than 2year yields. This can be seen as a signal of an upcoming recession as the higher nearterm yields mean higher risk expectations for the short term. Weekly jobless claims were slightly above expectations at 235000 unemployment claims. Initial claims have been hovering in a narrow range around 230000 claims per week for several weeks as the labor market remains tight.

        "Best way to lock in Dollar/Euro rate? Ive been planning a trip to Europe sometime next year maybe February or March and I thought it may be wise to exchange some dollars to euros ahead of time while the dollar is strong. I was wondering what the best way to do this is other than stuffing euros under my mattress. Would it be investing in something like $FXE now and then selling at the time of travel etc.? Thanks in advance for the replies/ideas"

        "The best stocks or sector ETFs to own during rising rates? Tldr; I just want to know your top ETFs stocks you have bought for the rising rate environment and why? Below is my just my current reasoning as well as some of my favorite   Ive recently rebalanced my 401k to be pretty diversified into ETFs and am looking to increase my exposure in my retail account to single stocks Ive bought plenty of tech stocks over the last few years and sold them off during the fall of 2021. Im very bullish on tech but I dont want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their moms have a different feeling on where the economy is heading but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info and that as of right now is that rates will go up probably beyond 3% and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with Chinas economy Covid/MP Supply chains Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.   So my question is what stocks individual or sector based ETFs do you believe will perform within the next 23 years as rates rise to 3%?   Ive done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow   My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy for now is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks most notably BAC.   My third pick would be a suite of DSF Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher inflation they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years the P/Es are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.   My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin Raytheon and Boeing.    To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV Tracks price of silver and GDX Gold Miners ETF along with UNH stock which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.   My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials 15% Defense/Aero 20% Precious Metals 10% Healthcare UNH   10% In Wells Fargo 10% XLF 20% Financials 5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials  Consumer Credit 5% Silvergate Capital this carries the highest risk in my opinion but Im bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.   5% BA 5% Raytheon 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace   10% SLV 10% GDX  20%  Precious Metals/Commodities   10% UNH stock  Healthcare   After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months Ive found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market technology would be going up or down but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks inflation and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldnt find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97 a share after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening and I dont want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear I want to make decisions based off a trajectory thats most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses as well as adding defensive stock like LHM RTX and Boeing which I think will have always been great names but now was the time to add to them for exposure.    I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me so a small update and where Im invested now.   20% BRKB  10% QQQ  10% VTI  10% VIG  10% HYG  20% GDX  20% ICLN   I do enjoy holding individual stocks but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio after maxing out to 20500/year and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETFs I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing Im financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.   I dont expect people to read this far but if you do what are your top stocks/ETF sector specific for the next 2 years and why?"

        "Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals Computer Software and Retail Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of smart money.  Money flow indicates staying power. That is when money is flowing into a sector related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.  How to use this study:  Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.  The magic sauce:  I use the Growth 250 list created by Investors Business Daily of which I am unaffiliated to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list tracking money flows between subsectors.  Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be ahuge boonto my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow whether positive or negative. And to put it simply this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.   This Weeks Money Flow Report  TL;DR  More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.  Buy Side   ChemicalsAgricultural     Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agrichemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.     Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.  Oil amp; Gas     More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week  would love to see them build a handle now. In addition with any more uncertainty in the strength economy these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.     One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC   it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by days end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil amp; gas names where they are now.  Utilities     As stated last week these are extended. Still the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil amp; gas Id like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place Id like to see as support for the handle.     AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch  if it breaks out of the handle could really run.  Sell Side   Computer Software     With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios  book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.     Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA  Retail     With most of the big retailers reporting last week we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in todays economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last weeks reports and some additional technical analysis:  1. Wholesale Building Products  FAST FND LOW 2. Discount amp; Variety  OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products  DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants  SBUX YUM   Review: Last Week  TL;DR  Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.  Fossil Fuels  Last weeks buy side focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powells comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.  Retail  Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST  which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fairvalue comparison.  Utilities  Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select  Utilities XLU did show some relative strength though down only 1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.  Semiconductors  Last weeks sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidias lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended that rotation was selfevident last week. Still the markets response to Chairman Powells comments from this mostly growthfocused area of the market was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH finished the week 5.56% making for some powerful down moves.  Alternative and Solar Energy  We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy ENPH still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only 3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.   Closing  Momentum studies like these can help make trading simpler.  Im always on Reddit and within the market so if you have questions know that you have my attention.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022.  Dow tumbles 300 points Friday posts worst week since September  Source  gt; Stocks finished lower Friday with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points or 0.9% to close at 33476.46. The Samp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3934.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11004.62.  gt; On a weekly basis the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The Samp;P tumbled 3.37% while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.  gt; Fridays moves came after Novembers producer price index showed higherthanexpected wholesale prices which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI which excludes food and energy also topped expectations.  gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears but attention remains laserfocused on next weeks busy economic calendar.  gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.  gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Feds aggressive tightening stance but the data fails to support that desire said Stephanie Lang chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.  gt; Its our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers she said. Theres still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.  gt; In other news shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weakerthanexpected fourthquarter outlook.

Since 1982 DJIA has advanced 30 times during Decembers options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. Samp;P 500 has a similar although slightly softer record. gt; However the record is not pristine. Last year accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018 DJIA and Samp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011 Europes debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012 the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after. gt; Going into next week the markets bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%4.50%. Todays slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  More Positive Signs for Inflation gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022 and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest most important economic event of our lifetime aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday today well look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing. gt; First up the consumer price index was up more than 9% yearoveryear in June but has since come back to 7.7% and we expect the trend to continue lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people arent paying as much for stuff there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows services prices have been more stubborn but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43 cut in half from March. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year but should it turn lower it could be a nice tailwind. Although the governments data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year and the trend remains firmly lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month so safe to say this is a widespread trend. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Once again government data lags behind private data and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases while private indices consider just new ones. Also for the official data rental units are sampled only every six months given that rents arent renegotiated very often. For this reason we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 812 months. gt; Additionally CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% backtoback months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth. gt; Lastly used car prices continue to sink. According to their data the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down yearoveryear 14.2% the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices the governments data tends to be slow to get with the picture so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the governments data more over the coming months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared we think it could come back down in 2023 and things like rents prices paid and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This of course would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.  gt;  Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings gt; Sentiment tipped over before the Samp;P 500s rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This weeks reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% a reading in the middle of this years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Overall sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 SPY December Drop gt; The Samp;P 500 SPY has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally SPY did manage to move back above its 200DMA but it couldnt quite get above the past years downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today and while further declines could result in a break down it would also mark an impressive but not exactly unheard of streak of declines. As shown below it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact this months 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY since inception and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines both of those previous instances saw larger drops roughly around 4.5% than the 3.5% decline currently. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2  gt;  Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day. As shown below SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy XLE is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary XLY and Financials XLF. Utilities XLU is down the least so far in December at just 0.50%. gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The AllWorld exUS ETF CWI and the Emerging Markets ETF EEM are both down just 1.2% MTD and the AllWorld exUS ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence. gt; For most of the year heading into December we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks but recently as stocks have dropped bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month with the 20 Year Treasury TLT up the most at 4.35%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below of the yeartodate percentage change total return of the Nasdaq 100 QQQ and the 20 Year Treasury ETF TLT is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month QQQ is down 3.98% while TLT is up 4.35% but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  BacktoBack Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Chances are you have already heard about the Samp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest Samp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance followed by 8.0% in October 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable up 13.79% in two months. gt; Based upon the Bull amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Traders Almanac all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020 2009 2002 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish but choppy during the 1month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21year Seasonal Pattern for December. gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the Samp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 1520 trading days after the streaks end. Following this period the Samp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1year after the streak ended.ail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  When does the Santa Claus Rally Start? gt; As we noted on the blog last week December is historically a strong month for stocks and we dont expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the thirdbest month for the Samp;P 500 since 1950 April and November are stronger and thirdbest during a midterm year with October and November better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt; Taking things a step further though when does Santa come to town? One of the most wellknown investment axioms is the Santa Claus Rally and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December but this isnt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me given that this is when Santa comes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Leveraging Money Flow: Cyclicals Computer Software and Retail Let momentum inform strategy to ride the coat tails of smart money.  Money flow indicates staying power. That is when money is flowing into a sector related stocks will often experiences bounces after pull backs and develop sustained uptrends. And when money is flowing out of a sector you might see pops get successfully shorted and bearish trends establish themselves.  How to use this study:  Day traders can use subsector momentum studies like this one to identify momentum stocks and develop greater conviction in a predicted move.  The magic sauce:  I use the Growth 250 list created by Investors Business Daily of which I am unaffiliated to understand the depth and breadth of the market any given week. This is their best estimation of the top 250 growth stocks in the market. I keep a running study of this list tracking money flows between subsectors.  Keeping an eye on this flow has proven to be ahuge boonto my edge. I have found that when I trade in subsectors that are seeing changes in money flow that there is an increased level of continuation that correlates to the flow whether positive or negative. And to put it simply this translates into bigger moves with reduced chop.   This Weeks Money Flow Report  TL;DR  More rotation into other areas of Specialty Chemicals as the entire Chemical Sector flattens out with another industry group breaking out. Even more flow into Oil amp; Gas and Utilities as commodities see continuation. Meanwhile Computer Software and Retail are looking like a sell.  Buy Side   ChemicalsAgricultural     Cyclicals continue to lead as growth stocks sell on economic uncertainty. With the war in Ukraine continuing to wreak havoc on the Agrichemical supply and the market seeking opportunity in essential commodities right these names broke out last week. They look really extended and not actionable this week as more consolidation is needed. Still worth watching them action for more signals on how the market is reacting.     Favorite name in this industry group is: CF with NTR and MOS looking worthy too.  Oil amp; Gas     More of the same here. It will be interesting to watch big cap leaders XOM CVX MRO this week  would love to see them build a handle now. In addition with any more uncertainty in the strength economy these stock are could just as easily sell or at best need more consolidation.     One I like here from a technical perspective is RRC   it has yet to really breakout. I also like the relative strength of APA MUR CRK. If I trade these names I may look to close out the position by days end to avoid any sensitivity to news catalysts versus trying to swing trade these oil amp; gas names where they are now.  Utilities     As stated last week these are extended. Still the inflow continues in these names. Similar to oil amp; gas Id like to see them pull in here and make a handle. Utilities seem to have a head start on this as they were very extended going into last week and closed around the place Id like to see as support for the handle.     AES has yet to break out of its base. NEE looks strong testing handle support to close Friday as well. AMPS is a very aggressive mover to watch  if it breaks out of the handle could really run.  Sell Side   Computer Software     With growth companies getting slapped by the Fed last week this is no surprise. Many have insane valuations with some worthy set up for short selling. These are strictly growth companies with high P/E ratios  book values that are going to suffer under tighter monetary policy.     Some worth watching include: FTNT DDOG NET SPLK $U OKTA  Retail     With most of the big retailers reporting last week we were able to build more of a picture of how consumers are behaving in todays economy. Even the most defensive retailers struggled on their reports for many reasons we talked about in an earlier report. There are specific areas of retail to target based on last weeks reports and some additional technical analysis:  1. Wholesale Building Products  FAST FND LOW 2. Discount amp; Variety  OLLI BIG FIVE 3. Leisure Products  DKS BFV ASO 4. Restaurants  SBUX YUM   Review: Last Week  TL;DR  Last week added up to a very satisfying week to be long commodities taking profit in solar/alternative energy and going short semiconductors.  Fossil Fuels  Last weeks buy side focused on coal names to respond to gains from alternative energy as of late. BTU made for a nice trade up nearly 12% for the week but was drug down by Chairman Powells comments to a final gain of 6.64% to close the week. Same story with the oil and gas names we identified although they were also drug down into close Friday with everything else.  Retail  Value retail names did not pan out as hoped DLTR earnings report was highly disappointing. That said we did not trade any of these but did notice that KR had more relative strength versus COST  which confirms an earlier concern that COST is probably a bit overpriced here by fairvalue comparison.  Utilities  Utilities took a pause here as well. The SPDR Select  Utilities XLU did show some relative strength though down only 1.53% and perhaps building a handle for more upside on a tough week for stocks.  Semiconductors  Last weeks sell side took focus on semiconductors with Nvidias lowered guidance going into earnings and most of those names looking very extended that rotation was selfevident last week. Still the markets response to Chairman Powells comments from this mostly growthfocused area of the market was SELL. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH finished the week 5.56% making for some powerful down moves.  Alternative and Solar Energy  We also looked to rotate out of alternative energy and solar positions as they take a pause. Enphase Energy ENPH still looks like it could hold this breakout range down only 3.74% on the week but will need some time to consolidate and produce enough earnings/sales momentum to decompresses the valuation before another leg up is rational.   Closing  Momentum studies like these can help make trading simpler.  Im always on Reddit and within the market so if you have questions know that you have my attention.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 5th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 5th 2022.  Major stock averages slide for third week Nasdaq posts sixday losing streak  Source  gt; U.S. equities fell on Friday to cap their third straight weekly decline after a solid August jobs report failed to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would keep aggressively hiking interest rates to fight inflation.  gt; After rallying through the morning the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 370point gain and finished the session lower by 337.98 points or about 1.1% at 31318.44. The Samp;P 500 fell roughly 1.1% to 3924.26 its lowest close since July. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.3% to 11630.86 recording its first sixday losing streak since 2019.  gt; All of the major averages were lower to end the week making it their third negative week in a row after slumping in the final days of August. The Dow and Samp;P lost roughly 3% and 3.3% respectively while the Nasdaq fell 4.2%.  gt; Theres still a lot of nervousness around what well see over the next few months said Callie Cox U.S. investment analyst at eToro. Yes inflation and the job market are coming back into balance but at what cost? Markets are still figuring that out.  gt; To make matters worse the Samp;P 500 is trapped in the danger zone  below its three big moving averages she added. Those moving averages served as floors up until a few weeks ago. Now they seem to be ceilings that the index just cant bust through. The mood has definitely changed. While we may not test the lows of this selloff again we also may not reach new highs any time soon.  gt; Stocks had been weighed down throughout this week by hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that interest rate hikes arent going away anytime soon. Thats put traders on watch for a retest of the June lows especially knowing September is historically a poor month for the market. Some have suggested that if the Samp;P 500 fails to hold the 3900 level those summer lows could come back into play.  gt; Some investors were briefly comforted on Friday by the highly anticipated jobs report which showed the economy added 315000 jobs for the month just under the Dow Jones estimate for 318000. Stocks rallied in the first part of the day.  gt; The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% twotenths of a percentage point higher than expectations. The August report is particularly important because its one of the last major economic reports the Fed will weigh before it raises rates at its September meeting. This data point could help the central bank determine whether a 75basispoint hike.  gt; The last major economic report of note is August CPI on Sept. 13 and is more likely to determine how aggressive the Fed needs to be in the near term.

DJIA Samp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. DJIA Samp;P 500 and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last five years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the markets performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.30%. Samp;P 500 is weakest up only 47.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.29%. NASDAQ has a better record up 52.4% of the time on Wednesday but a smaller average gain of 0.26%.  gt;  Bears Back Above 50% gt; In the wake of Jackson Hole and more hawkish than previously expected Fedspeak the Samp;P 500 is on pace for its worst week since June. As a result recent improvements in investor optimism have been entirely given back. The AAII survey of individual investors saw only 21.9% of respondents report as bullish this week. That is the worst reading in two months as the backtoback declines over the past two weeks total 11.4 percentage points. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; That was matched with a considerable increase in bearish responses. For the first time since early July over half of respondents reported a pessimistic outlook for equities. Bearish sentiments eight percentage point weekoverweek increase was the largest since midJune and the third weekly increase in a row. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The inverse moves of bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bullbear spread to quickly move down to the worst level since the start of July. That follows a string of readings only a couple of weeks ago in which bears outnumbered bulls by only single digits. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Given the reversal in the spread the streak of negative readings presses on. Now at 22 weeks long it ties the 1990 streak for the second longest on record. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The AAII survey was not alone in showcasing a much more pessimistic tone of investors. Both the NAAIM Exposure Index and the Investors Intelligence survey also pivoted to more bearish readings. Combining these three results the average reading on sentiment has fallen back to more than one standard deviation below the historical norm. Although that is not as pessimistic of an aggregate sentiment reading as earlier this year there have only been a handful of other times going back to the mid2000s in which the investment community had as negative of an outlook towards the equity market. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  August Declines All Around the World gt; The end of August is here and US equities as measured by the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY have been on a wild ride. At the midmonth high SPY was sitting on a 4.3% monthtodate gain but that has more than entirely been erased as it is on pace to finish the month down closer to 3.5%. The country ETF of each other major global economy that we track in our Global Macro Dashboard is a similar story. Across these countries on average they had reached a 3.13% gain at their monthtodate highs but today they are down an average of 3.5% MTD. Overall developed markets have faired much worse than emerging market countries with average declines of 4.82% versus 1.24% respectively. In fact there are only two ETFsBrazil EWZ and India INDAthat are currently positive for the month. Meanwhile China MCHI is unchanged. On the other end of the spectrum Sweden EWD has been the worst performer nearing an 11% decline with a number of other European nations following up with the next worst performance. gt; With stock markets around the world giving up the ghost in August most have moved back below their 50DMAs or even into oversold territory. There are no country ETFs more than one standard deviation above their moving averages although EWZ and INDA have only moved out of overbought territory in the past week. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As we show in the table above this years declines have resulted in the average country ETF falling 24% below its 52week high. Those declines bring the vast majority of these countries back below preCOVID highs as well. At the moment there are only four countries that remain above preCOVID 52week highs: Taiwan EWT India INDA the United States SPY and Canada EWC. This exclusive group would need to fall substantially further to revert back to those prior highs and as shown in the chart below each one would also still have support at lows from earlier this year before preCOVID highs become a technical level worth eying. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  High Correlation Between Stocks and Bonds gt; So far in 2022 stocks and bonds have both sold off leading investors with a balanced portfolio to experience historically painful drawdowns. Rates have risen and partially because of this fact equities have had a tough year. The Samp;P 500 ETF SPY is down 16.0% on a YTD basis while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF AGG has shed 11.3% of its value. Typically rates fall alongside equities as investors shift their capital allocations to safer assets. 2022 has been different though and has seen selling in both bonds and equities. This has resulted in a historic level of positive correlation between the ETFs SPY and AGG going back to 2004 when AGG first started trading. Click here to start a twoweek trial to Bespoke Premium and receive our paid content in realtime. gt; Although the 200day correlation between stocks SPY and bonds AGG has been higher once before in late 2009 the current level remains particularly elevated. The current 200day correlation sits at 0.87 which signifies a strong positive relationship. In the last 200 days stocks have moved in the opposite direction of rates on most days as the market is incredibly focused on the bond market as the Fed transitions from an accommodative to a restrictive stance in the face of higher inflation. Interestingly the correlation coefficient does appear to be rolling over moving lower in each of the last 15 trading sessions. Historically speaking the correlation coefficient has tended to turn negative not long after rolling over as illustrated by the chart below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The more we zoom in the more the rollover becomes clear. The higher frequency measures such as the 100 and 50day correlation coefficients have already moved substantially off of their recent highs even though they are still elevated relative to history. The 100day correlation coefficient is now at just 0.70 while the 50day coefficient is even lower at 0.55 the lowest levels since midJune and midMay respectively. This tells us that the 200day correlation will likely pull back further thus giving SPY a chance to gain even as rates rise and visaversa. As evidence of this today SPY is down over 125 basis points even as AGG is up six bps moving in opposite directions. To make a long story short bonds and stocks may begin to diverge in terms of performance as the correlation between the two assets begins to roll over. Now you just have to figure out which direction theyll each go gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The rolling 100day correlation between stocks and bonds has been over 0.5 or 50% for 129 trading days which is the longest streak since the inception of AGG by a considerable margin. Although the coefficient is declining the 100day correlation would need to drop another 0.2 points for this streak to end. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Continuing Claims Catching Up gt; Initial jobless claims had a strong showing this week as the previous reading was revised lower by 6K to 237K. From that revised level claims fell another 5K down to 232K marking the lowest reading since the last week of June. That was also handily below expectations which were calling for an increase up to 248K. With another week over week decline claims have now fallen for three weeks in a row; the longest streak of declines since February. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; On a nonseasonally adjusted NSA basis the current week of the year has historically marked the annual low. Assuming that is the case this year 176.8K is in line with the readings from the comparable week of the year in 2018 and 2019. Although further declines are not out of the realm of possibility assuming normal seasonal patterns NSA claims will likely rise from here through the end of the year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Continuing claims are lagged an additional week to initial claims.. While continuing claims remain low having avoided the same degree of upward drift that initial claims have experienced this year this weeks reading did move up to 1.438 million. That marks the most elevated level since the first week of April. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Recently we have been highlighting the ratio of initial claims to continuing claims as a way of showing the disconnect between the two seasonally adjusted readings. In other words the lack of filter through of initial claims into continuing claims which can be extrapolated as those filing for unemployment are quickly finding new roles. Although the ratio remains well above the historical norm and especially the range of readings observed since the early 1990s it has begun to roll over in the past five weeks. As for just how big of a drop it has been the decline ranks in the bottom 2% of all 5week moves on record. While that is not to say the overall claims picture initial claims not turning into continuing claims has completely turned around it is a sign that continuing claims have been playing a degree of catchup. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 2nd 2023 Happy New Year Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market on this final trading week of 2022 and are ready for the new trading year ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 2nd 2023.  Stocks fall to end Wall Streets worst year since 2008 Samp;P 500 finishes 2022 down nearly 20%  Source  gt; Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points or 0.22% to close at 33147.25. The Samp;P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10466.88.  gt; Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a threeyear win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022 down about 8.8%. The Samp;P 500 sank 19.4% and is more than 20% below its record high while the techheavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.  gt; Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.  gt; Weve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. Theyve all been very serious. But for investors it is what the Fed is doing said Art Cashin director of floor operations for UBS on CNBCs The Exchange.  gt; As the calendar turns to a new year some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.  gt; I would love to tell you that it is going to be like the Wizard of Oz and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that Cashin said.  gt; Despite the yearly losses the Dow and Samp;P 500 did break threequarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq however dominated by the likes of Apple Tesla and Microsoft muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December however.  gt; Communication services was the worst performing sector in the Samp;P 500 this year falling more than 40% followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise climbing 59%.   This past week saw the following moves in the Samp;P:  CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL Samp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK  Samp;P Sectors for this past week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE Samp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK  Major Indices for this past week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK  Major Futures Markets as of Fridays close:  CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY  Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:  CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD  Percentage Changes for the Major Indices WTD MTD QTD YTD as of Fridays close:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Samp;P Sectors for the Past Week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Fridays close:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Major Indices Rally Levels as of Fridays close:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.  Here are the upcoming IPOs for this week:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Fridays Stock Analyst Upgrades amp; Downgrades:  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  One Years Loss Is Not the Next Years Gain gt; Its finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes especially equities. As of this writing the Samp;P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the indexs history there have only been nine other years in which the Samp;P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean were due for a big gain the next year. gt; In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the Samp;P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for nextyear performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the Samp;P fell 15% five times the index posted gains the next year while four times the index posted further declines. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Lets Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row gt; As bad as 2022 has been for investors there is a silver lining: backtoback declines in the Samp;P 500 are rarer than you may think. gt; If you go all the way back to 1950 the only times that stocks fell in backtoback years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately we dont see similar scenarios within the current environment so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Taking a closer look into the data we found: gt;  The year after a negative return saw the Samp;P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time. gt;  A 10% or greater loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time. gt;  Out of the 20 negative years only three times did returns get worse the following year in 1974 2001 and 2002. gt;  However the following year significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average in 1975 2003 and 2009. gt;  Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As we head into 2023 we are putting the finishing touches on our Outlook 2023 be on the lookout for it early next year.  gt;  What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall? gt; Its not what you look at that matters; its what you see. Henry David Thoreau gt; Ive done this for more than two decades and I have to say the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks while the second half of the year should be better. But lets be clear overall the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors as we explained here. gt; The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012 and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013 and the economy did just fine. gt; You see the stock market is always pricing things in and if everyone is talking about it you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it. We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors and the general consensus is that next year will be bad also. So the question is how are we supposed to respond to this? gt; What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet we have inflation coming down very quickly an economy while notably slowing for sure that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession in part thanks to a very strong consumer and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar. gt; Thats right the first quarter in a preelection year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh it was also up 7.4% on average the very best quarter out of the entire fouryear Presidential cycle. On top of that the second quarter has also performed quite well too. So we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here and I sure dont hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.  gt;  2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment gt; As we noted in an earlier post todays release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been. gt; For starters the bullbear spread heavily favors bears and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below the spread has been negative meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish for a record 39 weeks in a row over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Across all weeks in 2022 bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987 that is a record low. In fact the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990 respectively. Meanwhile the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2% surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009 only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As we highlighted in an earlier tweet given the low readings on bullish sentiment there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing aboveaverage bullish sentiment nearly every week this year 51 has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31% tying the record high set in 2009. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As previously mentioned bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks 30 with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year 1988 one year after the survey began was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average that ties 2008 for the record high. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year gt; Lastminute taxloss selling old sayings such as year ends make great exits a desire to start with a clean slate who knows exactly the answer but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twentytwo years. Since 2000 NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twentytwo years after having been up twentynine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and Samp;P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twentytwo years. Russell 2000s record very closely resembles NASDAQ gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Country ETFs in 2022 gt; Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries. gt; With 2022 drawing to a close there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil EWZ and Mexico EWW. Neither are up much but up is up especially in a year like this one. gt; In terms of monthtodate change Hong Kong EWH has risen the most with a 5.62% gain while China MCHI is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum Taiwan EWT has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share longterm capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  PreElection Year Januarys Stellar  1 Samp;P 500 and NASDAQ 2 DJIA gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks 1 for NASDAQ since 1971 but sixth on the Samp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best threeconsecutivemonth span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities. gt; DJIA and Samp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twentythree Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA 8.8% and Samp;P 500 8.6% since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid19 spoiled January in 2020 amp; 2021 as DJIA Samp;P 500 Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021 DJIA Samp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022 surging inflation reaching multidecade highs stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January. gt; However in preelection years Januarys have been outright stellar ranking 1 for Samp;P 500 NASDAQ Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 and 2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and Samp;P 500 have only declined twice in preelection Januarys 2015 and 2003. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Falling FAANG gt; Yesterday Amazon AMZN became the third of the megacap FAANG stocks along with META and NFLX to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZNs postpandemic gains been erased but its now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; NYSEs FAANG index is described as an index of 10 of todays highlytraded tech giants. Given that most of the FAANG stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted Samp;P 500 they are an impactful group. As shown below the FAANG index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past Novembers low. On a relative basis the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Below is a look at the ten FAANG stocks. As shown they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion and theyre ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple AAPL has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon AMZN has seen its market cap fall the secondmost at $843 billion essentially getting cut in half. Tesla TSLA along with AMZN is one of two names that lost their $1 trillion market cap club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG stocks that are down 50% on the year include Meta META NVIDIA NVDA Netflix NFLX AMD and Snowflake SNOW. gt; With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December on an absolute basis 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008 the Russell 3000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today the Russell 3000s market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG stocks shown below. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "Why would other party exercise options exercised early? Messed up the title: gt;Why would a counterparty exercise their option early? I sell options. The last few weeks a number of the ITM put options I sold got executed on early. It doesnt impact me too much but it left me a bit confused and wondering why the counterparty or the other side would want to do this? In detail its like SNAP puts at around strike $30 that expire Jan/23 and EWZ puts at $37 that expire in Sep/22. Normally speaking it would be better to sell those puts on the open market for money since you can monetize both the intrinsic amp; extrinsic values of the option. Executing early wipes out the extrinsic value. So why would they want to exercise rather than sell the option? Maybe they want the cash right now and/or have trouble selling those options? Maybe its a whale that wanted to add buy/sell pressure on a stock? Maybe it has something to do with the underlying securities or market vol? Is it merely as simple as tax efficiency and LT cap gains related maybe other party had shares of SNAP in LT category?"

Nasdaq adds 1.9% Samp;P 500 closes nearly 1% higher and notches best week since June  Source  gt; The Samp;P 500 closed out its best week since June as a report on Thursday showing slowing inflation raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its tightening campaign.  gt; The broader market index added 0.9% to close at 3992.93. This brought its gain for the week to 5.9% its best week since the one ended June 24 of this year. The Nasdaq Composite added about 1.9% to end at 11323.33 as investors snapped up tech shares on hopes interest rates would ease. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1% closing at 33747.86.  gt; Tech stocks on Friday shook off a decline in cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies tumbled sharply this week and once again came under pressure Friday after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and CEO Sam BankmanFried resigned. Bitcoin and ether both declined.  gt; Still tech stocks and related crypto stocks rebounded after opening lower Friday. The tech sector in the Samp;P 500 surged 10% through Friday its best weekly performance since April 2020. Amazon was up more than 4% on Friday while Googleparent Alphabet was 2.6% higher.  gt; The Dow jumped more than 1200 points on Thursday following a smallerthanexpected rise in consumer prices for the month of October giving investors hope that inflation may be cooling. The Samp;P rose 5.5% and the Nasdaq Composite surged about 7.4%. It was the best day since 2020 for all three indexes.  gt; Treasury yields plunged Thursday on the back of the weakerthanexpected inflation print. The bond market was closed on Friday to observe Veterans Day.  gt; From an equity market perspective as long as the threat of much higher rates is out the way this should remove a major headwind Barclays head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.  gt; All of the indexes posted a winning week.

From that low point on 10/13 XLF is up 20.2%. As shown below the ETF is currently at the very top end of a wide sideways range that has been in place over the last six months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Below is a sampling of some of the most wellknown banks and brokers that are part of the Financial sector. As shown names like Goldman Sachs GS JP Morgan JPM Jefferies JEF Raymond James RJF and Stifel SF are all more than 10% above their 50DMAs and the only stock thats not overbought gt;2 standard deviations above 50DMA is LPL Financial LPLA which traded lower on earnings yesterday. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; A quick look at the sixmonth price charts of the stocks listed in the table above gives you a glimpse into the huge rally that this area of the market has experienced since early October. Investors have seemingly been loading up on them with shortterm Treasury yields now significantly higher than the interest rates these banks and brokers are paying customers on deposits. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Homebuilders Extended gt; Every day we browse through our Trend Analyzer tool available with a Premium or Institutional membership to monitor trends and overbought/oversold levels across financial markets. When we got to the homebuilder stocks this morning we had to do a doubletake after seeing some of the recent moves in this space. Have a look at the moves in the snapshot below. Most homebuilder stocks have rallied 1215% over the last five trading days leaving them in extreme overbought territory which means theyre more than two standard deviations above their 50day moving averages. DR Horton DHI Lennar LEN NVR NVR and PulteGroup PHM are the most extended. Even after the rally in these names over the last week wed note that theyre still all down sharply yeartodate as the spike in mortgage rates from 3% up to 7% has caused activity in the space to slow to a crawl. A drop in those mortgage rates over the last few days was the catalyst for the recent move higher in share prices. If youre wondering which way the homebuilders are likely to trade going forward keep an eye on interest rates  thats the entire story these days. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  A Very Encouraging Inflation Report Including Goods Deflation Finally gt; One month does not make a trend but todays consumer price index CPI report was very positive. Dare I say its probably the best inflation report weve seen in about 15 months especially because there were so many encouraging signs in it. This is a huge relief and markets appear to be responding in kind. Samp;P 500 futures were up more than 3% after the CPI report was released and as of lunchtime the rally continued. gt; Lets walk through it. gt; Headline inflation rose 0.4% in October as expected. Core inflation which strips out volatile food/energy prices and is arguably more important for the Federal Reserve Fed surprised: rising 0.3% in October below expectations for a 0.5% jump. This is the lowest monthly increase since September 2021. gt; Looking back over the past year headline inflation is up 7.8%. Thats high but thats come down from 9.1% in June. A big part of the deceleration was falling energy prices  you can see how the lighter red bars have been making up a smaller portion of inflation over the past few months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In the chart above you can see that Food prices continue to make a big piece of inflation dark red bars. But we got a break here as well. Food at Home i.e. groceries which make up close to 9% of the inflation basket rose just 0.4% in October  the lowest in more than a year and well below the average 0.7% monthly increase weve seen over the first 9 months of the year. gt;  The Goods Deflation Weve Been Waiting For gt; Weve been talking about how private inflation data has been showing decelerating prices for goods outside energy and food. Just yesterday my colleague Ryan Detrick wrote about collapsing used car prices. Retailers have been telling us for a while that theyre discounting items as well. Weve just been waiting for the official inflation data to catch up and looks like its doing that finally. gt; Theres a broad list of goods including used cars that saw prices fall in October which is what makes it even more encouraging. The items below make up about 11% of the inflation basket and 14% of the core basket. Falling household goods prices probably reflect the slowdown in residential activity as home sales collapse amid higher mortgage rates. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  Are Rents Breaking? gt; The best part about goods deflation is that it offsets high services inflation. As you can see below the blue bars are now below the zero line for the second month in a row. We also got good news in the form of medical care services  which was a function of falling health insurance premiums. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The biggest part of the inflation basket is Shelter including rents on primary residences and something called Owners Equivalent Rent OER which is the implied rent that owneroccupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes. The latter is also determined using rents of equivalent homes as I wrote about a month ago. In other words OER is effectively a measure of rents and altogether rents make up a whopping 40% of the core inflation basket. gt; And rents have been rising putting a lot of upward pressure on core inflation. You can see the gray bars in the previous chart growing larger and larger over the past year. gt; However market rents have been decelerating quite rapidly over the last few months  Ryan discussed this just yesterday. The problem is it hasnt shown up in the official inflation data because of methodological reasons we wrote about this quite extensively. gt; But the official rental data may be beginning to turn. Rent of primary residence rose 0.7% monthovermonth and OER rose 0.6% in October which is lower than what weve seen over the previous couple of months. Make no mistake a 0.7% rise is still a lot  that translates to an annualized pace of 9% which is why the Fed is really worried about it. But hopefully the October data is a sign that the official data is beginning to turn and follow the private data lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt;  What does this mean for Fed policy gt; Perhaps the most important question. gt; As I said at the top one month is not a trend. But this is not random. It jives with all the other leading indicators of prices which have been showing a deceleration in prices. And now it looks like the official data is catching up. gt; With respect to policy Fed officials are unlikely to change their minds based on one report. Theyll probably need to see at least three of these before starting to view it as convincing evidence that inflation is on its way down. gt; But what todays CPI does is that it buys time. Yet another hot inflation print would have put more pressure on the Fed to raise rates even further. By coming out on the soft side the report increases the odds for a soft landing scenario. In other words inflation and wage growth can hopefully come down without the Fed having to ratchet rates higher and higher which would eventually break the labor market.  gt;  Haves and Have Nots gt; As evident in our Sector Snapshots over the past several days and as we discussed yesterday on Twitter sector performance has lately been a tale of the haves and havenots. The areas of the market that possess some of the most heavily weighted stocks namely Communication Services Consumer Discretionary and Technology have drastically underperformed other cyclical sectors like Financials Industrials and Materials. As a result relative strength lines have blown out. Shown another way in the charts below we show the ratios of each of these sectors relative to the Samp;P 500. A rising line would indicate the sector is outperforming the broader market and vice versa. gt; Communication Services has been in a brutal downtrend in relative strength terms for more than a year now and the recent drop has been steep. While the ratio of Consumer Discretionary to the Samp;P 500 has been more range bound in recent years there have been a few wild swings in the past year. The most recent swing lower is leaving it close to the lowest levels since early 2015. Techs decline has not been nearly as sharp but the ratio here has nonetheless rolled over to some of the lowest levels of the past few years. Conversely Financials Industrials and Materials have all seen their ratios rip higher to the upper end of the past few years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In measuring just how sharp of moves these ratios have experienced they have been outright historic. As for the most pronounced moves the drops in the lines of Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary rank in the bottom percentile of all 10day moves since 1990 when our sector data begins. The only periods in which the ratios fell by similar degrees if not by more were during the Dot Com bubble. While Techs ratio is at new multiyea rlows its decline was large ranking in the 17th percentile but not nearly as sharp standing out much less than the aforementioned sectors. gt; Like Tech the moves in Financials and Materials have also been quite large and rank in the top decile of all 10day moves but those are far from records. The outperformance of Industrials on the other hand has been remarkable. As of yesterdays close the ratio versus the Samp;P 500 rose 7.24% over the past two weeks. Only three other daysMay 19 through May 21 2020since 1990 have seen higher readings. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Small Business Labor and Inflation Slumping gt; The NFIB released its October data on small business optimism this morning. The headline index was expected to show further deterioration in optimism and exactly that occurred as the index fell to 91.3 from last months reading of 92.1 versus expectations of 91.4. This months reading is off of the spring lows which had surpassed the worst levels from the early stages of the pandemic but remains one of the weakest readings of the past several years. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; In the table below we provide a breakdown of each category of the report. The headline index is now just off the bottom decile of readings as most components are likewise historically depressed. While the report was weak there were some exceptions with strong showings in labor market metrics like Plans to Increase Employment Job Openings Hard to Fill and Compensation. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Even though these labor market metrics have remained at very high levels from a historical perspective they have largely been rolling over for the better portion of the past year. Hiring plans as well as the percentage of firms reporting cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues are back to similar levels as the year prior to the pandemic. Meanwhile actual employment changes are negative as they have been throughout the pandemic implying businesses are reporting a net decline in workers. That is in spite of still elevated compensation and a sharp spike higher in compensation plans. In fact that index is just shy of the peak from the final months of 2021 after a record 9point monthovermonth jump. Companies are also reporting job openings remain hard to fill although that index has also been on the decline alongside hiring plans. This month the reading was unchanged at 46 the lowest level since June 2021. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Sales components have experienced far greater degrees of deterioration than employment metrics. The outlook for general business conditions has rallied back somewhat in the past few months but it remains well below its historical range. Given the weakness in small businesses economic outlook few report now as an opportune time to expand their businesses. Actual sales changes dropped to 8 in October which matched August for the weakest showing for sales since August 2020. Back in 2020 though this index was far lower than it is now. gt; While the reading on the top line has held up relatively well high inflation has meant the bottom line has taken a big hit. A net 30% of small businesses reported earnings have fallen. That reading did improve last month though as there have been fewer businesses reporting higher prices. In spite of those improvements each of those indices has a long way to go until returning to what have historically been more normal levels. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As mentioned above a historically low share of businesses are reporting positive sentiment on the economy and that has dampened their hopes of expansion. When questioned on the reason for not expanding 44% reported economic conditions as the reason. Another 17% reported economic conditions as the reason for uncertainty on whether or not they would expand. Aptly coming out on Election Day we have highlighted in the past the political nature of the NFIB survey. As such it should come as little surprise that the next biggest reason for small business hesitancy in expanding has been the political climate. Assuming the survey results react to the current election in a similar way as in the past a strong election showing for Republicans could provide a boost to small business sentiment and plans for expansion. Finally given continued high inflation and rates rising to combat it the next two most widely mentioned reasons to not expand were the cost of expansion and financial conditions and interest rates with a combined 9% of responses. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Whats Bothering Small Businesses? gt; As we noted in an earlier post the pandemic trends of tight labor markets and high inflation continue to show up in the latest NFIB survey of small business optimism albeit readings have begun to roll over. The survey also questions firms on what they perceive to be their most pressing problems. Perhaps even more than the other indices in the report the results of these questions have shown how front and center labor and inflation concerns continue to be. gt; As shown below most problems have seen record or nearrecord lows. Meanwhile twothirds of responses report either cost or quality of labor or inflation as their biggest problem. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; At 33% inflation as the single most important problem has well surpassed the previous record high set during what was a much less dramatic inflationary spell in 2008. Although this reading rose 3 percentage points versus September it is in the middle of the past few months range. In other words inflation is slightly less of a concern than it was a few months ago which is confirmed by the decline in the higher prices index but that is certainly not to say it is no longer the single most pressing problem. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Another third of responses reported either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues. Quality is the bigger concern of the twowhich is normal from a historical perspectiveaccounting for a 23% share. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; As we frequently note the NFIB survey has a tendency to be impacted by politics with a bias towards Republican administrations. For example during the Bush and Trump years there was a far lower share of respondents reporting government requirements and taxes as their biggest concerns. With the prominence of inflation Bidens tenure has resulted in a different scenario in which these issues have been placed on the back burner. Granted these issues still account for the most pressing problem of a combined 17% of responses. We would also note these readings have seen some dramatic moves around midterm election months but those have not always been lasting. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Finally we would note that very few businesses only 3% are worried about poor sales. That is a recordlow share and unchanged for the third month in a row. As we noted in our discussion of the other areas of the report that lack of concern for the top line contrasts with businesses hopes for expansion and the outlook for the economy. In fact of the reasons given for firms reporting now as not a good time to expand sales prospects were the least pressing reason given. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Beyond the Midterm ElectionsLess Uncertainty and Historically Solid Samp;P 500 Performance gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; It is finally Election Day and hopefully soon the results will start rolling in. Once the outcome is known it will likely alleviate some of the uncertainty that has been contributing to the markets volatile trading which could help the market snap out of its Fedinduced funk. In the chart above the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 18 midtermyear elections appear NASDAQ since 1974. Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election approximately three months DJIA Samp;P 500 and NASDAQ were higher on average from 6.4% to 9.2%. gt; Digging deeper into the data the following table shows Samp;P 500 performance 1 3 6 and 12months after the election. 1 and 3months after the election Samp;P 500 was higher 77.8% and 88.9% of the time respectively. By 6months and 1year after Samp;P 500 was always higher although gains did slow after 6months. Years when the Presidents party lost its majority in Congress are shaded in gray. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The Sweet Spot of the 4year cycle is now. The headwinds that abound this time around are not entirely unlike past midterm years that have historically been mired by bear markets and uncertain economic and political times. Many of the current concerns do appear to be accounted for by the markets declines coming into Q4. Inflation does remain stubbornly high despite the Fed aggressively raising rates this year. The Feds most recent statement may not have been as dovish as some had hoped for but it did contain language that suggested the time to slow the pace of increases and possibly even pause hikes is closer now than it was six months ago. The market is likely to remain volatile as it awaits more clarity from the Fed and more signs that inflation is easing. Any back and fill periods by the market are likely an opportunity to consider adding to existing long positions or establishing new longs.

        "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week and are ready for the new trading week ahead. : Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th 2022.  Dow tumbles 300 points Friday posts worst week since September  Source  gt; Stocks finished lower Friday with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.  gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points or 0.9% to close at 33476.46. The Samp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3934.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11004.62.  gt; On a weekly basis the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The Samp;P tumbled 3.37% while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.  gt; Fridays moves came after Novembers producer price index showed higherthanexpected wholesale prices which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI which excludes food and energy also topped expectations.  gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears but attention remains laserfocused on next weeks busy economic calendar.  gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.  gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Feds aggressive tightening stance but the data fails to support that desire said Stephanie Lang chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.  gt; Its our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers she said. Theres still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.  gt; In other news shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weakerthanexpected fourthquarter outlook. DocuSign jumped on strong results.

Since 1982 DJIA has advanced 30 times during Decembers options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. Samp;P 500 has a similar although slightly softer record. gt; However the record is not pristine. Last year accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018 DJIA and Samp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011 Europes debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012 the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after. gt; Going into next week the markets bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%4.50%. Todays slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  More Positive Signs for Inflation gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022 and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest most important economic event of our lifetime aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday today well look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing. gt; First up the consumer price index was up more than 9% yearoveryear in June but has since come back to 7.7% and we expect the trend to continue lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people arent paying as much for stuff there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows services prices have been more stubborn but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43 cut in half from March. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year but should it turn lower it could be a nice tailwind. Although the governments data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year and the trend remains firmly lower. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Lastly rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month so safe to say this is a widespread trend. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Once again government data lags behind private data and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases while private indices consider just new ones. Also for the official data rental units are sampled only every six months given that rents arent renegotiated very often. For this reason we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 812 months. gt; Additionally CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% backtoback months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth. gt; Lastly used car prices continue to sink. According to their data the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down yearoveryear 14.2% the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices the governments data tends to be slow to get with the picture so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the governments data more over the coming months. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared we think it could come back down in 2023 and things like rents prices paid and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This of course would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.  gt;  Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings gt; Sentiment tipped over before the Samp;P 500s rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This weeks reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7% a reading in the middle of this years range. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Overall sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  Samp;P 500 SPY December Drop gt; The Samp;P 500 SPY has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally SPY did manage to move back above its 200DMA but it couldnt quite get above the past years downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today and while further declines could result in a break down it would also mark an impressive but not exactly unheard of streak of declines. As shown below it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact this months 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the Samp;P 500 ETF SPY since inception and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines both of those previous instances saw larger drops roughly around 4.5% than the 3.5% decline currently. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 1 gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE 2  gt;  Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day. As shown below SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy XLE is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary XLY and Financials XLF. Utilities XLU is down the least so far in December at just 0.50%. gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The AllWorld exUS ETF CWI and the Emerging Markets ETF EEM are both down just 1.2% MTD and the AllWorld exUS ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence. gt; For most of the year heading into December we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks but recently as stocks have dropped bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month with the 20 Year Treasury TLT up the most at 4.35%. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; The chart below of the yeartodate percentage change total return of the Nasdaq 100 QQQ and the 20 Year Treasury ETF TLT is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month QQQ is down 3.98% while TLT is up 4.35% but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  BacktoBack Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Chances are you have already heard about the Samp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest Samp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance followed by 8.0% in October 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable up 13.79% in two months. gt; Based upon the Bull amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Traders Almanac all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020 2009 2002 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish but choppy during the 1month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21year Seasonal Pattern for December. gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the Samp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 1520 trading days after the streaks end. Following this period the Samp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1year after the streak ended.ail to call bears may come to Broad and Wall. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  gt;  When does the Santa Claus Rally Start? gt; As we noted on the blog last week December is historically a strong month for stocks and we dont expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the thirdbest month for the Samp;P 500 since 1950 April and November are stronger and thirdbest during a midterm year with October and November better. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog: gt;  When stocks are down for the year heading into this month December has been higher eight of the past nine times. gt;  Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013. Midterm years have been worse lately down a record 9.1% last time in 2018 but also down in 2014. At least weve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years. gt;  When stocks are up in both October and November which could be the case this year as long as we dont see a massive drop today the Samp;P 500 doesnt do quite as well in December up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54% suggesting the prior months could be taking some of Decembers historical strength. gt;  Lastly only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the Samp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time and it caused massive selling but this month is usually quite calm and big drops are rare. gt; Taking things a step further though when does Santa come to town? One of the most wellknown investment axioms is the Santa Claus Rally and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December but this isnt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me given that this is when Santa comes. gt;  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead  gt;  T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.

        "The best stocks or sector ETFs to own during rising rates? Tldr; I just want to know your top ETFs stocks you have bought for the rising rate environment and why? Below is my just my current reasoning as well as some of my favorite   Ive recently rebalanced my 401k to be pretty diversified into ETFs and am looking to increase my exposure in my retail account to single stocks Ive bought plenty of tech stocks over the last few years and sold them off during the fall of 2021. Im very bullish on tech but I dont want to make the mistake of exposing myself heavily in the event the economy falters in 2023/24 due to interest rates causing a housing crash/recession. Everyone and their moms have a different feeling on where the economy is heading but for my own sake I try to stick with the most reliable info and that as of right now is that rates will go up probably beyond 3% and the most recent job numbers seem to give the Fed reason to do so but that is always changing. I also know that the issues with Chinas economy Covid/MP Supply chains Capex and Europe all are things to consider but those are things I feel have less certainty to them.   So my question is what stocks individual or sector based ETFs do you believe will perform within the next 23 years as rates rise to 3%?   Ive done some research about this recently and I feel Silvergate Capital is a really strong play on rates increasing as well as a pretty affordable P/E also I am bullish on crypto so this makes sense to my values as well as generally doing well within the space with positive cash flow   My second pick would be Wells Fargo or XLF if you want broad based diversification obviously Financials do very well with rate hikes and with the most recent job number it seems that the economy for now is strong enough to support a rate hike. I think Wells Fargo is in the best position to benefit from hikes than other banks most notably BAC.   My third pick would be a suite of DSF Mastercard and Visa because obviously they do better when prices are higher inflation they also benefit from higher rates with outstanding balances and have performed very well in the recent years the P/Es are a little high but I feel these stocks long term are pretty standard to have in any portfolio.   My last few notable mentions are ones I also plan on picking up but are most hedges than anything but I still feel will do will in the current environment. To hedge any upcoming wars or further aggression as well as a rebound in the aerospace/flight markets I would buy Lockheed Martin Raytheon and Boeing.    To hedge against recession risk I plan on buying SLV Tracks price of silver and GDX Gold Miners ETF along with UNH stock which provides a healthy dividend and has very strong financials.   My asset mix would probably be as such 55% Financials 15% Defense/Aero 20% Precious Metals 10% Healthcare UNH   10% In Wells Fargo 10% XLF 20% Financials 5% DSF 12.5% Visa 12.5% Mastercard 30% Financials  Consumer Credit 5% Silvergate Capital this carries the highest risk in my opinion but Im bullish on crypto and this stock is set to gain 16m/year income for every quarter point rate increase and it cash flow postive.   5% BA 5% Raytheon 5% Lockheed Martin 15% Defense/Aerospace   10% SLV 10% GDX  20%  Precious Metals/Commodities   10% UNH stock  Healthcare   After doing a lot of research over the last couple weeks and months Ive found myself feeling pretty optimistic and pessimistic about the market I thought about whether my favorite sector of the market technology would be going up or down but time and time again I find myself questioning the global political risks inflation and interest rates weighing on the housing market and growth stocks. I couldnt find a way to position my money into individual stocks. I recently bought AMD at 77 and sold for 97 a share after being idiotic about my Roth IRA. I do want to take advantage of the one thing I know for sure will be happening and I dont want to overshadow my decisions because of greed or fear I want to make decisions based off a trajectory thats most certain. This portfolio is built under the assumption that rates will rise and that in the event of a recession I will have hedged against my losses as well as adding defensive stock like LHM RTX and Boeing which I think will have always been great names but now was the time to add to them for exposure.    I was unable to update everyone on my IRA as the post would not let me so a small update and where Im invested now.   20% BRKB  10% QQQ  10% VTI  10% VIG  10% HYG  20% GDX  20% ICLN   I do enjoy holding individual stocks but a ROTH IRA is not the place to do so I will do what I said above with my retail portfolio after maxing out to 20500/year and diversifying my assets across many different sectors and ETFs I feel confident I can balance my retail account between individual stocks while still having a good amount of risk tolerance and sector balance. I know that individual stocks are risky and many may not agree with my decisions but I enjoy doing this and if I am one of the 90% who makes under market returns than I will live with my decisions in life happy enough knowing Im financially secure and doing alright. I will hopefully post an update in a year or so while I sit tight in a position I feel comfortable while selling covered calls every month to help hedge my risk tolerance further. My %s may change as I figure out which stocks have the best returns with covered calls and what not but this is my current estimation.   I dont expect people to read this far but if you do what are your top stocks/ETF sector specific for the next 2 years and why?",
        "Overinvested in AMZN. Help me diversify A large portion of my taxable income is in the form of AMZN stock grants over many years.

But picking stocks is hard. What market am I missing? How can I better counterbalance against a large AMZN holding? I believe AMZN is a good investment but Im an engineer not a day trader and I really only need to do as well as the rest of the market. Other notes:  No I cant buy AMZN puts. Company policy. And Im not going to short QQQ. Stop. Im looking for basic diversification help.   I own a house so Im staying away from REITs and housing marketsensitive stocks. Im overinvested in real estate too.  I would love to hear about tech stocks and consumer discressionary stocks that dont follow the price AMZN. This is the most difficult place for me to invest. I own some TXN because IoT is the future and a little SHAK because hamburgers are delicious but not much. I keep these bets small. I wish I could find something profitable and anticyclical with AMZN in these sectors.   This is a problem with my taxable accounts. My IRA/401k accounts are lowexpense target date funds and I dont think I need to change them.  I buy the max amount of Ibonds and I dont need any more bonds in my taxable accounts.  I am 40 and I dont need to cash in my taxable accounts over the next decade.",
        "Invest using US or UK exchange? Hi all I live in the UK. The first investment platform is used when I statyed investing was etoro. Etoro let me invest on the US stock exchange so I was allowed to buy etfs like VOO VTI etc. Ive just opened a stocks and shares ISA on another platform and I want to invest long term on that one. However they dont list US ETFs like VOO. What they have is the ishares UK equivalent. Ive had a quick comparison to compare US ETFs with their UK counterparts eg. XLF vs IUFS and I see that theyre not too dissimilar in terms of performance actually the UK ones tend to outperform the US ones very slightly. My concern is regarding trading volumes. The UK ETFs have much lower volumes compared to US ones. Should I be worried? Also since both exchanges open at different times how do they perform so similarly since the buyers are living in different countries? Part of me fears of missing out of the bigger US market if I was to buy UK isharsa ETFs. Thank you all in advance.",
        "Adding sector specific ETFs or keeping only broader market ETFs?

Right now its mainly things like VTI VOO AVUV VXUS and VYM. I was thinking of adding things like XLF XLE or XLP to focus on specific industries but I was wondering if it was worth it historically to add emphasis on certain sectors or if I should just keep it broad focusing on things like total market large cap vs small cap value vs growth etc. Thoughts?",
        "Invest in a single Broad Index ETF vs Multiple Sector EFTs? I am setting up a weekly recurring investment in ETrade which allows for partial ETF buys with automation.

I am aware the VOO/VTI vs sector ETFs are not equivalent but are there any benefits to being more specific in what I buy rather than just doing VOO/VTI? I like the idea of being able to tailor and customize percentages specifically into a sector as market conditions change and also seeing performance by sector over time."

        "Marijuana ETF questions vs alternative approaches to get exposure Digging across marijuanafocused ETF portfolios Ive found many seem to own swaps or TRS derivatives of shares.

Its something thats been on my mind for a while"
